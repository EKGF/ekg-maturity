        this concept is defined in many different ways. One way is to say that "critical data elements are
        those data elements that are critical to success in a specific business area".
        This could be a regulatory area such as BCBS 239 or the enterprise as a whole or any other use case area.
        In an \gls{ekg} context, especially at the higher levels of \gls{ekgmm} maturity,
        \myuline{all data is critical} since the criticality of data is always dependent on the context.
        For any given data point, there is a raison d'Ãªtre in a given context.
