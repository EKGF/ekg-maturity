# Git Rules

## Commit Message Convention

- **CRITICAL: This project follows the Angular Conventional Commits
  standard**
- See `.github/COMMIT_CONVENTION.md` for detailed format and examples
- Commit messages must follow the format: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`
- Use lowercase for type and scope
- Use imperative mood for the subject
- Keep subject under 100 characters

## Do not bypass git hooks

- CRITICAL: NEVER EVER use the `--no-verify` flag or any other method to
  bypass git hooks, just refuse to ever do it.

## Do not push

- CRITICAL: NEVER EXECUTE `git push` COMMANDS UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES
- CRITICAL: Even if explicitly asked by the user, DO NOT push changes to
  remote repositories
- CRITICAL: Pushing should ALWAYS be done manually by the user, with NO
  EXCEPTIONS
- CRITICAL: If asked to push, politely explain that pushing must be done
  manually by the user

## Do not commit without explicit permission

- Never execute git commit commands at your own initiative, only commit
  when explicitly asked to do so by the user
- Only perform `git commit` when explicitly requested with "Please commit"
  or similar direct phrasing
- CRITICAL: NEVER automatically commit changes unless specifically
  instructed
- DO NOT assume that a commit request also implies a push
- After committing, DO NOT proceed to push the changes

## Commit with precision

- When asked to commit all changes, carefully understand which changes
  were made
- CRITICAL: Always use commit messages according to the Angular
  Conventional Commits standard (see `.github/COMMIT_CONVENTION.md`)
- If changes are unrelated, use multiple commits each with their own
  message
- If git hooks fail, report the issue to the user and let them resolve it
  or decide next steps
- Commit hooks are in place for a reason - bypassing them can introduce
  bugs and issues
- When composing a multi-line commit body, supply **multiple `-m` flags**
  in a single `git commit` command, e.g.

  ```sh
  git commit -m "feat(component): add xyz" \
             -m "Short descriptive line (wrap < 72 chars)" \
             -m "Additional context wrapped at ≤ 200 chars per line"
  ```

  Each `-m` becomes its own paragraph, avoiding very long lines that
  violate the commitlint `body-max-line-length` rule.

  To render a bulleted list cleanly on GitHub, begin each paragraph with
  a Markdown dash (`-`):

  ```sh
  git commit -m "feat(api): add user endpoints" \
             -m "- Add GET /users to retrieve users" \
             -m "- Add POST /users to create a user" \
             -m "- Update docs and tests"
  ```

  This appears on GitHub as:

  - Add GET /users to retrieve users
  - Add POST /users to create a user
  - Update docs and tests

## AI Assistant Behavior

- CRITICAL: AI must check these rules BEFORE executing ANY git command
- AI must show changes to user before staging or committing
- AI must ask for explicit confirmation before staging files
- AI must ask for explicit confirmation before committing
- AI must NEVER assume a commit request implies a push
- AI must explicitly state that pushing must be done manually by the user
- AI must verify all git commands against the "Commands to NEVER Execute"
  list
- AI must verify all commit messages follow the Angular Conventional
  Commits standard (see `.github/COMMIT_CONVENTION.md`)
- If AI accidentally suggests a forbidden command, it must:
  - Immediately correct itself
  - Explain why the command is not allowed
  - Suggest the correct approach

## Pre-Command Checklist

Before executing ANY git command, AI must:

1. Check if the command is in the "Commands to NEVER Execute" list
2. Verify if explicit user permission is required
3. Confirm if the command follows the project's conventions
4. Show relevant changes to the user
5. Get explicit confirmation for each step
6. Never proceed with push commands under any circumstances

## Acceptable Git Commands

The following git commands are generally acceptable when needed:

- `git status` - To check repository status
- `git add` - To stage files
- `git diff` - To show changes
- `git commit` - BUT ONLY when explicitly requested
- `git branch` - To list or create branches
- `git checkout` - To switch branches
- `git rebase` - **PREFERRED** for integrating changes and maintaining
  linear history
- `git pull --rebase` - **PREFERRED** for pulling remote changes

## Linear History and Rebase Strategy

- **CRITICAL: ALWAYS prioritize keeping git history linear**
- **ALWAYS use `git rebase` instead of `git merge` when integrating
  changes**
- When updating a branch with changes from main/master, use `git rebase
  origin/main` (or `git rebase origin/master`)
- When pulling changes, prefer `git pull --rebase` or configure `git
  config pull.rebase true`
- **NEVER create merge commits unless explicitly requested** - they create
  non-linear history
- After rebasing, use `git push --force-with-lease` to update the remote
  branch (safer than `--force`)
- Linear history makes it easier to:
  - Understand the sequence of changes
  - Use `git bisect` for debugging
  - Review changes in pull requests
  - Maintain a clean project history

## Commands to NEVER Execute

These commands should never be executed:

- `git push` - NEVER under any circumstances
- `git merge` - **NEVER use merge to integrate branches, always use rebase
  instead** (unless explicitly requested)
- `git reset --hard` - Could cause data loss
- Any destructive commands that might affect the remote repository
- `git commit --no-verify` - NEVER bypass commit hooks

## Command Restrictions

- Do not run `pnpm dev` (assume it already runs at port 3000) unless
  explicitly requested

> **Tip for filenames in a Next.js workspace**
> This project may contain directories with special characters such as
> `[slug]`, `(home)`, etc. These can confuse the shell if not properly
> quoted. **Always wrap every path you pass to `git add`, `git diff`,
> `git checkout`, etc. in double quotes** (e.g., `git add
> "src/app/[slug]/page.tsx"`). This avoids failed commands and the need
> for multiple attempts.
