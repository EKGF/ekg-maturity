# YAML Formatting Rules

## Frontmatter and YAML Files

When editing YAML files or frontmatter sections in Markdown files:

1. **Always use multiline syntax** instead of long quoted strings
   - Use `>-` (folded block scalar with strip) for single-line strings
     that need to wrap
   - Use `|` (literal block scalar) when preserving line breaks is
     needed
   - Use `|-` (literal block scalar with strip) when preserving line
     breaks but removing trailing newline

2. **Always keep lines shorter than 70 characters**
   - Break long strings across multiple lines
   - Each line should be under 70 characters for readability

## Examples

### Good (multiline, < 70 chars per line):

```yaml
description: >-
  Learn how to build composable, scalable enterprise knowledge through
  reuse. Discover how the Use Case Tree Method enables safe reuse of
  knowledge assets across teams and domains.
```

### Bad (long quoted string):

```yaml
description:
  "Learn how to build composable, scalable enterprise knowledge
  through reuse. Discover how the Use Case Tree Method enables safe
  reuse of knowledge assets across teams and domains."
```
