# How to register?

We are asking every potential contributor, even someone who just wants to give us
some feedback (a "critic") to join the EKGF as a private member (free) or as a
corporate member.

Email with [registration@ekgf.org](mailto:registration@ekgf.org) to set it up,
if you plan to participate as a contributor to the EKG/MM then please also
supply your GitHub user-id.

## How to create a GitHub & Slack account?

### Slack

If you already have a Slack account then join the EKGF workspace
here: [https://ekgf.slack.com/](https://ekgf.slack.com/).
Otherwise, first create your Slack account [here](https://slack.com/get-started\#/create).

### GitHub

Go to [https://github.com/join](https://github.com/join).

Since you can associate multiple email addresses to your GitHub account we would
suggest to initially create it with your private email address which then becomes
your "primary email account" in GitHub.
You can add your business email address(es) to your GitHub account later.

Mail your GitHub account id (user-id) to
[registration@ekgf.org](mailto:registration@ekgf.org) so that we can add you
to the access control list of the [EKGF/ekg-mm repository](https://github.com/EKGF/ekg-mm).
