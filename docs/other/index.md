# Other

The Enterprise Knowledge Graph Foundation is working on multiple initiatives that
have lead to various websites:

## ekgf.org

The main website of the Foundation: [https://ekgf.org](https://ekgf.org)

## Principles

The EKG/Principles: 
[https://principles.ekgf.org](https://principles.ekgf.org), 
this is a project that is being maintained in the GitHub repository 
[EKGF/ekg-principles](https://github.com/EKGF/ekg-principles).

The EKG/Principles website is a combination of long term vision statements---the
"Why"--- combined with the underlying principles for EKG---the "How".

You're welcome to contribute.

## Maturity Model

The Maturity Model for the Enterprise Knowledge Graph (EKG/MM): 
[https://maturity.ekgf.org](https://maturity.ekgf.org),
this is a project that is being maintained in the GitHub repository 
[EKGF/ekg-maturity](https://github.com/EKGF/ekg-maturity).

You're welcome to contribute.

## Catalog

> Use cases and their Datasets & Ontologies

The EKG/Catalog describes all the common use cases (and some of their "sub-use cases") for EKG:
[https://catalog.ekgf.org](https://catalog.ekgf.org)

One major goal that we are working towards to is to publish "use cases as executable models"
and make them available for download as modules, basically creating the same
kind of ecosystem of reusable components as many other successful technology-stack have.
This is comparable to what ["Maven Central"](https://central.sonatype.org/) is for
the Java world or what ["npmjs.com"](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm) is for the
JavaScript world.

You're welcome to contribute.

## Use Case Tree Method

A proposal for a front-to-back method to support your EKG journey: 
[https://use-case-tree-method.ekgf.org](https://use-case-tree-method.ekgf.org), 
this is a project that is being maintained in the GitHub repository 
[EKGF/use-case-tree-method](https://github.com/EKGF/use-case-tree-method).

You're welcome to contribute.

## Audiences

### Use Cases
- Short term:
    - Audience: Business Executive, Vendor
      - Understand the business problems that can, and have, been addressed
      - Use a framework for structuring projects
      - Get directed to relevant reuse points in other portals (e.g. for ontologies)
- Long term:
    - Audience: Executive, Vendor, Knowledge Graph Engineer
      - Identify, select, download & provision production-ready use cases

### Best Practices

- Audience: Project Lead, Consultant, any role in the EKG Center of Excellence
    - Reduce the risk and cost associated with new EKG projects
- Audience: Vendor
    - understand how to develop, sell and deploy their products (and services)
      to maximize applicability and success

### Software

- Audience: Architect, Vendor, Academic
  - Access reusable software curated for EKG purposes (may be hosted externally)
- Audience: Vendor, Academic
  - Position existing products or components to increase uptake

### Ontologies

- Audience: Modeler
  - Assess ontologies curated as reusable for a given use case
  - Apply tooling to automate ontology development and measurement
- Audience: Academic
  - Access a set of ontologies for research, analysis, or extension

### Datasets

- Audience: Analyst
  - Access reusable RDF resources curated for EKG purposes (may be hosted externally)
- Audience: Analyst, Vendor
  - Make use of data resources for demonstration and experimentation

### Member Directory & Services

- Connect with people and parties with the knowledge to help (see also [corporate members](corporate-members.md))
- Promote your knowledge and skills

## Persona Stories

The Foundation recognizes different types of "personas" that it needs to serve:

| `<as a>`               | `<I want to>`                                                                                                                                                     |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Business Executive** | Realize the benefits and minimize the risks of EKG by having access to proven methods, best practices and a community of experts.                                 |
| **Vendor**               | Make it easy for organizations to understand and successfully adopt my product across multiple industry sectors.                                                  |
| **Modeler**              | Have access to a proven and consistent set of deployable use cases, models \& ontologies that can be used with my organizationâ€™s EKG.                             |
| **Technical Architect**  | Have access to components and interfaces with supporting technology architectures that I can assemble and deploy within my environment.                           |
| **Consultant**           | Have access to---and contribute to---EKG-related best practices (e.g. EKG/Method \& EKG/MM) as well as a community of potential customers and skilled associates. |
| **Academic**             | The chance to make a meaningful and recognized contribution that builds upon frameworks to address pressing business needs.                                       |
| **EKG Engineer**         | be informed about best practices, role descriptions, education and certifications.                                                                                |
