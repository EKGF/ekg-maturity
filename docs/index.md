# Maturity Model

The Enterprise Knowledge Graph Maturity Model (EKG/MM) is 
the industry-standard definition of the capabilities required 
for an enterprise knowledge graph.  
It establishes standard criteria for measuring progress and sets 
out the practical questions that all involved stakeholders ask 
to ensure trust, confidence, and usage flexibility of data.  
Each capability area provides a business summary denoting its 
importance, a definition of the added value from semantic standards, 
and scoring criteria based on five levels of defined maturity.

The Foundation hosts open working sessions to debate the contents 
toward the achievement of consensus.
