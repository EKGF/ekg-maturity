# Introducing the EKG Matrix Pattern & KGI Value

The Enterprise Knowledge Graph (EKG) 0-5 Level Maturity Model is an industry-standard 
knowledge management guideline with topics that support an evidence-rating system 
for organizational use of Knowledge Graphs (KG). 

In particular, it uses [Pillars](/pillar/) of meta-knowledge, each containing the domain 
specific assessment criteria, needed to produce a business maturity metric for, 
one or more essential capabilities and/or, specialization use cases and/or, 
value streams e.g. Operational value streams and /or development value streams.


## EKG Matrix Pattern

For instance, a granular evidence based Pattern for a single Business Use Case 
may be produced via a Business Use Case Maturity Matrix utilizing a 
Business Capability Axis, and a Domain (Organization, Data  and Technology) 
Pillar Axis. 
It may also be used when the assessment scope is for, all Business Value Streams 
that is specific to a distinct subset of cross Domain / Pillar (D/P) capabilities. 

Note: When an EKG matrix pattern encompasses two or more Business Use Case / 
Domain / Pillar the Pattern will reflect a compound maturity metric:


Business Use Case – **Enterprise Initiative Prioritization**<br/>
EKG Matrix pattern identifies D/P Maturity Levels:  2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2

| D/P | D/P | D/P | D/P | D/P | D/P |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|     |     | xXx | xXx |     |     |
| xXx | xXx |     |     | xXx | xXx |
|     |     |     |     |     |     |

Business Use Case – **Merger and Acquisition Evaluation and Integration**<br/>
EKG Matrix pattern identifies D/P Maturity Levels:  3, 3, 4, 3, 3, 3

| D/P | D/P | D/P | D/P | D/P | D/P |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|     |     | xXx |     |     |     |
| xXx | xXx |     | xXx | xXx | xXx |
|     |     |     |     |     |     |
|     |     |     |     |     |     |

Business Use Case – **Identify Redundant Vendor Contracts**<br/>
KG Matrix pattern identifies D/P Maturity Levels:  3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 3 

| D/P | D/P | D/P | D/P | D/P | D/P |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|     |     |     |     | xXx |     |
| xXx | xXx | xXx | xXx |     | xXx |
|     |     |     |     |     |     |
|     |     |     |     |     |     |

## Knowledge Graph Indicator (KGI) Value

When in scope for a named business (KG + Vector Value have a common Business Identifier) 
domain specific assessment criteria may explicitly reference the evidence-rating of a 
Knowledge Graph Indicator (KGI). 
Wherein, the KGI is a type of Key Results Indicator (aka Key Risk Indicator) that 
incorporates process outcome as a maturity factor. 
Whereas, content of the KG construct --- that lays out how specific business objects, 
events, situations are related --- has been subjected to a predefined treatment that 
inherently increased the value of that knowledge when utilized for the identified 
business capability. 
Whereby, a business capability may have one or more value vectors that are unique to 
their value chain. 

For example:

- Business Impact Vector : Readability > Understandability > Influenceability
- FAIR Principles Vector :  Findability +  Accessibility +  Interoperability

## Evidence Rating

Evidence rating is often a scale that indicates quality of evidence, such as, 
high, moderate, low, and very low. Further, the method used to determine 
quality of evidence level is published. 
As in,
- Formulaically, a process may be any combination of task, function, 
  activity performed in a cycle that has a declared value + is specific to 
  one or more Pillar domain
- Semantically, a process outcome may be defined as a domain specific goal, 
  objective, proposed value proposition or measurable result identified for 
  a particular strategy, plan, tactic or use case
- Cross Domain specific use cases can have different cycles and outcomes e.g.
  - intellectual property safeguards
  - data privacy protections 
  - information security controls
  - value chain definitions 
- Quality of evidence that a KG was subjected to a predefined treatment may be:
  1. Actual process outcome was verified by semantic matching with planned outcome
  2. Process treatment was designed to enhance the value for a structure
     composed of same types of business objects, events, situations
  3. KGI Zone Parameters (which identify salient properties, such as, the 
     beginning-edge and the ending-edge of the particular knowledge graph) 
     are within stated tolerances
