# Dimensions of Knowledge Risk Assessment

## Risk to be Measured

The FCC (USA Federal Communications Commission) has advised that 
every business that uses the Internet is responsible for creating 
a culture of security that will enhance business and consumer confidence. 
Additionally, they should have a risk strategy focused on safeguarding 
their business capabilities, customers, and digital assets from growing 
threats. 
That strategy should be based on a risk event analysis that identifies:

- Undesirable Outcome & Threat causal relationship e.g. 
  Supplier communication breach
- Threat Severity e.g. Catastrophe via infrastructure failure; 
  Slow Burn via climate change
- Vulnerability of at-risk Business Capability e.g. 
  Digital asset storage not protected
- Probability of Risk e.g. Layer of Protection Analysis per event frequency

The Risk Strategy must also have knowledge about the business 
Tolerance to Risk. 
Which requires an assessment focused on the strength / weakness of 
each safeguard and its ability to mitigate one or more Threats. 
Further, it requires the business to determine Acceptance Level limits
for the Vulnerabilities that exist, the Business Capabilities that are 
at-risk and the exposure that would have an Undesirable Outcome. 
To help measure changes in probabilities-of-risk the business should 
use a _Key Risk Indicator (KRI)_. 
For example, when used for continuous risk event analysis the KRI(s) 
would signal any changes in risk exposure and help identify the 
business capabilities that require a safeguard investment.

### Sustainability

A _Sustainable Risk Assessment (SRA)_ is designed to help decision makers 
understand how potential data protection threats (and other challenges) 
may impact strategic objectives. 
The assessment may be as simplistic as the two factor (Morningstar.com) 
_Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG)_ rating. 
Which considers, the "Exposure" that measures a companyâ€™s vulnerability
or susceptibility to risk, and the "Management" actions taken to address
a risk issue. 
The assessment may employ a ^^Qualitative^^ risk technique, such has,
a probability and impact matrix, a risk categorization, 
a risk frequency ranking, or a risk urgency prioritization. 
It may also use a ^^Quantitative^^ risk method that employs 
weighted outcome, probability ratio and expected Business Value analysis.
Finally, it may employ a multiple factor scoring methodology, 
similar to the CDP global disclosure system that recognizes 
participation in Climate Change, Water, Forests and Supply Chain programs[^1].

!!! note "Exemplar KRI & Risk Factor"

     **KRI:** Number of Notifications Received from Regulators
     reflects total number of notifications that the business receives 
     from regulators during the measurement period.
     
     **Risk Factor:** A high volume of notifications can be an indicator of
     weak compliance controls which may increase exposure to financial, 
     reputational and operational risk .

### Strategy

A Risk Management Strategy should include a process for regularly updating 
and reviewing essential factors based on the outcomes from actions taken 
to continuously identify, assess and manage the known risk. 
It may also leverage a _Sustainability Risk Management Framework_ that 
references the essential factors and their relationship with the 
measurable dimensions of key objectives - Value chain drivers; Risk exposure;
Response design; Value Outcomes; Performance[^2].

!!! note "Exemplar KRI & Risk Factor"

     **KRI:** _Percentage of Key Performance Indicator (KPI) Targets Not Met_
     reflects the number of objectives that have targets which are not being 
     achieved. 

     **Risk Factor:** An indication that the management of a large number 
     of objectives is unsatisfactory may expose the company to operational, 
    financial and reputational harm.

### Portfolio

To support Portfolio-level analysis a quantitative risk assessment and management 
framework identified the phases of a Value of 
Asset driven analysis > 
scenario identification > 
consequence and criticality assessment > 
security vulnerability assessment > 
threat likelihood assessment, > 
benefit-cost analysis[^3].
Key to this methodology is the use of plausible threat scenarios based on a 
target susceptibility and a threat likelihood assessment that captures 
adversary tendencies to shift their preferences in response to security investments.

!!! note "Exemplar KRI & Risk Factor"

     **KRI:** _Value at Risk (VaR)_ reflects the probability that 
     asset losses will occur within a given portfolio over a given 
     period of time and can be calculated using historical data and/or 
     proprietary models.

     **Risk Factor:** The probability could be based on a worst case 
     situation where the amount is a realized loss and there is an 
     order of magnitude harm to reputation.

### Project

A _Project Risk Analysis_ assesses how a Vulnerability would impact the 
targets set for key Objectives, such as, Project Cost, Delivery Schedule, 
Technical Performance and Business Value. 
Moreover, when there are many Threats the determination of Project Priorities 
would likely use a most-to-least-critical importance ranking[^4].  
Further, to ensure the prioritization algorithm accurately reflects needs 
All the Factors of All Objectives should be included e.g. factor in 
Time Criticality as part of the calculation for the Scheduling Objective .

!!! note "Exemplar KRI & Risk Factor"

     **KRI:** _Percentage of Projects Currently in Progress That are Delayed_
     reflect measurements of all the issues that delayed any project. 

     **Risk Factor:** Excessive project delays expose the business to 
     financial, strategic, operational and reputational risk.

### Technology

To help Secure Critical Information Infrastructure the 
European Union Agency for Network and Information Security 
has created an evaluation Framework[^5]. 

It primarily consists of a logic model presenting a set of steps 
and a list of possible KPIs that map to the objectives of the evaluation model.

!!! note "Exemplar KRI & Risk Factor"

      **KPIs:**

      * Identification of Critical Information infrastructures.<br/>
        Performance Factors: Evidence of registries of  business capability 
        specific critical assets, dependencies, risks, vulnerabilities
      * Risk Assessment and Risk Management Procedures / Plans.<br/>
        Performance Factors: Evidence of  definitions of risk centric 
        procedures that have a stated frequency of knowledge updates
      * Business Recovery and Continuity Plans for Critical Infrastructures.<br/>
        Performance Factors: Evidence of strategic documents - implementation guides, 
        [Use Case Tree](https://method.ekgf.org/concept/use-case/), 
        RACI (responsible, accountable, consulted, informed) Chart
      * Successful Information Sharing and Trusted Cooperation.<br/>
        Performance Factors: Evidence of trusted channels for communication; 
        Enterprise Knowledge Graphs for stakeholders, partners and participants
      * Transparency and Accountability of Systems.<br/>
        Performance Factors: Evidence of different types of documentation 
        available to the public e.g. Knowledge Graph
      
      **KRI:** _Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF)_ reflects the stability of 
      systems following a resumption of service that had been suspended 
      due to failure. 
  
      **Risk Factor:** A large value for this metric may indicate that 
      systems are unstable and underlying architecture must be further examined.

### Knowledge

When Assessing Risk it can be readily accepted that accumulated Knowledge
leads to a better awareness of _What has greater Certainty_ and 
_What remains Uncertain_. 
Moreover, to have a culture of security, it is critical that all the 
strategic decision makers (Business Capability stakeholders, 
Project Engineers and others in key roles) share a common understanding 
of _What is at Risk_. 
That shared knowledge may be the core content of a _Business Capability Portfolio (BCP)_
that is purposed to assure that Business Capabilities are attuned to a 
Sustainable Risk Appetite, protected by a Risk Management Strategy, 
and provisioned by Risk Mitigation Technology.  

!!! note "Exemplar KRI & Risk Factor"

    **KRI:** _Risk Larger Than Appetite_ reflects that current 
    Risk score is greater than the amount of risk the business 
    is willing to accept to achieve its objectives. 

    **Risk Factor:** The more the risk score exceeds Risk Tolerance
    the greater the probability the business is exposed to 
    catastrophic financial, strategic, operational and reputational damage.

## Next Steps

The task of populating a BCP will likely employ a digitization process 
that converts the characteristics of a physical object / process into a 
digital form and, as a Value-Add, create a _Digital Twin (DT)_[^6] 
construct. 
Moreso, to provide operations intelligence that span its lifecycle, 
The BCP would have Use Case Tree connections to Knowledge Graphs, 
KPIs, KRIs  and the Business Capability that leverage it. 
As in, Safeguard physical properties declared in a Knowledge Graph 
are used to accurately represent how connected entities (e.g. 
Customers, Partners, Sales, Products, Locations) are protected 
in real life. 
Further, when the safeguard (DT) uses digital objects (representing 
images, sounds, signals) the response to physical warnings (sounds, 
flashing lights) can be better calibrated. 
Moreover when a Vulnerability is discovered, the 
[Use Case Tree](https://method.ekgf.org/concept/use-case/)
(of connected nodes) may be actuated to simulate how a proposed change 
in behavior could mitigate specific risks.
