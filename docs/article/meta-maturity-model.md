This is a work-in-progress article documenting our current thinking about
the meta-model of the EKG maturity model (EKG/Maturity) as we're documenting it on this website.
We're working on an OWL Ontology and describing all content --- under the [Pillars](../pillar/index.md)
menu-option that you see on this website --- in RDF so that we can then:

- enforce a consistent structure throughout
- create a dataset that anyone can build upon in their own EKG
- have a solid foundation for EKG/Maturity assessments

For simplicity's sake we're using UML in this article to document the model even though
UML is not able to fully cover the expressiveness of an OWL ontology.
But since this is not really a very complex model to begin with, UML will do.
