# Dimensions of Knowledge Value Assessment

## Measure Applied Knowledge

Continuing studies[^1] affirm that the relationship between 
knowledge sharing and innovation continues to grow. 
To help measure knowledge growth the _Enterprise Knowledge Graph (EKG) 
Maturity Model_ provides a single metric for an entire Enterprise’s 
utilization. 
To qualitatively identify maturity trends the Model is structured
with [Pillars](../pillar/index.md). 
To quantitatively measure maturity success the Model supports the 
use of dimension-specific data points. 
Additionally, to help explain the investment created at "Maturity" 
the dimensions may be used to formulate Business Value metrics.  
To assess value, many in the investment community use 
_Economic Value Added (EVA)_ and _Value Based Management (VBM)_.  
EVA, also known as _economic profit_, aims to measure _the True Value_ 
that a firm creates through its operation. 
VBM is a framework that is focused on having the EVA being a 
sustainable value. 
Often the first VBM step is determining the variations of a 
dimension that correctly measure that value.

## Value To Be Measured

Value analysts often use data science methods and computational art 
mechanisms to correctly measure dimensions. 
Especially, when algorithmic parameters must be used to convert 
_Business Value dimensions_ into _Key Performance Indicators_. 
More so, when the complexity of the innovation[^2] requires a 
dimension scope supporting the objectives of 
[Sustainability](#sustainability); 
[Innovation Strategy](#innovation-strategy); 
[Portfolio Management](#portfolio-management-of-value); 
[Project Management](#project-management); 
[Technology Management](#technology-management) and 
[Knowledge Management](#knowledge-management). 
Such as:

### Sustainability

For Sustainability to be maintained at a certain rate or level,
the objective would likely include all forms of Business Value
that indicate the health and well-being of an enterprise. 
The most likely core objective would be to have a _Value Proposition_
that gives the customer the reason to choose their offering. 
Another likely objective would be the [Value Stream Management](../pillar/business/business-model-elaboration/value-chain/index.md)
focused on the flow of Value Chain activities performed when 
validating a product-market proposition.

### Innovation Strategy

Innovation Strategy often has an objective to have unique products
that differ significantly from those of competitors. 
When _Differentiation Innovation_ is an objective the 
_USP (Unique Selling Point)_ would provide a clear Value Proposition.
There may also be _Strategic Decision_ to introduce a _Value Innovation
objective_ of having Differentiation at Lower Cost.
Which may be measured via _Expected Monetary Value (EMV) Analysis_ 
that compares cost, e.g. design, marketing, packaging, to product revenue.

### Portfolio Management of Value 

Portfolio Management of Value may be based on the objective that 
innovation resources are only invested in assets that deliver 
true value.  
!!! note inline end "True Value"

     Statistically, True Value is obtained with perfect 
     measuring instruments (without committing any error of any type) 
     both in collecting the primary data and in carrying out 
     mathematical operations.
Computationally, _Return On Investment_ may be calculated by 
subtracting the amount invested from the asset value; 
_Total Portfolio Valuation_ may be based on the value of all 
assets owned. 
Which in turn may use _Benefits realization management (BRM)_ 
techniques to identify the True Value of an asset.

### Project Management

Project Management can be considered a success if it delivers 
on an objective that has a predetermined Business Value. 
That determination may use _Value Stream mapping_ to create a
visual guide of the changes necessary for that delivery. 
Additionally, _Project Value_ may be expressed using _Business Case 
rationale_ that evaluates the benefit, cost and risk of alternatives.
_Stakeholder Value_ may also be recognized for those with 
tangible objectives. 
Such as, performs better; is easier or more convenient to use; 
is more reliable; is more durable; is more available to more customers.

### Technology Management

Technology Management is recognized as a _Value Driver_ when it 
enhances _Business Capabilities_ that add profitability, reduce risk, 
and promote asset growth. 
For instance, Technology may be treated as a Value Driver when 
it is used to transform data into an economic asset. 
As in, the resulting "Data Asset" is used to improve operations, 
increase revenue, solidify relationships with stakeholders,
produce new revenue streams, improve the quality of current products, 
establish competitive differentiation, allow innovation, and reduce risks.

### Knowledge Management

_Knowledge Management (KM_) has historically been defined as the 
structured development, transfer, dissemination and application 
of knowledge. 
More forward-looking thinking, Paoloni c.s.[^3] has KM being key
to innovation and is a component of entrepreneurial capital or 
intellectual capital. 
Moreover, Indra Abeysekera[^4] identified that KM and 
_Intellectual Capital_ have become inseparable partners in 
enterprise value creation. 
Especially when Knowledge Value Chain tasks result in 
embedded knowledge products / services that have a 
unique competitive advantage or social benefit. 
That outcome may be also feature in a 
_Value Driver Tree_ (also known as _KPI Tree_) 
that links the Business Values to the Drivers
(e.g. embed into service) to help identify those which have 
the greatest impact on total value

## Next Steps

As concluded in a knowledge metrics survey by Matošková[^5], 
it seems sensible to employ Knowledge as an Asset measurement
that enhance _Intellectual Capital objectivity_ and 
_Value Creation transparency_. 
Such as, create a [Use Case Tree](https://method.ekgf.org)
for Intellectual Capital measurement that may include - Knowledge Graph Identifier; 
Stakeholder Awareness : System Measure : Output Measure : 
Outcome Measure : Economic Asset Measure .
