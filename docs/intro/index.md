# Introduction

The EKG Maturity Model is a “continuous improvement” product of the EKGF.

It is intended to be updated based upon the comments of readers and implementers.
Comments are reviewed by EKGF members and may result in new or changed content.
In order for comments to be seen, the commenter must have a 
[GitHub ID](../other/process.md#how-to-create-a-github--slack-account).

After review and acceptance of comments, the EKGF process automatically updates the MM.
It is not necessary to be a member of EKGF to read and comment in the MM.
It is necessary to be a member of the EKGF to be included in 
[the review process](../other/process.md).
