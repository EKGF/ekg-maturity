# The Five Maturity Levels

This document will refer---for each capability---to the five maturity levels.

## Level 1

- The domain of internal PoCs, pilots or---ideally---"Lighthouse Projects".
- The focus is usually on specific targeted baseline use cases constructed 
  using isolated ontologies.
- The champions are visionaries who have assembled a specialist team for
  implementation---possibly the start of the "EKG Center of Excellence".
- Funding is likely to be project-based and designed to demonstrate capabilities.

### Business

- Stakeholders recognize business opportunities in scaling and
  amplifying capabilities through [EKG use cases](https://catalog.ekgf.org/use-case/).
- The first internal champion is seeking to socialize strategic use cases,
  supports innovation, and is willing to take on the disruption challenge.

### Organization

- Champions are internal visionaries who have assembled a specialist team
  for implementation.
- The pilot is sanctioned and funded. 
- Knowledge acceleration is being addressed. 
- Overall organizational support is emerging.
  
### Data

- Core data management capabilities are being performed such as inventory, 
  data architecture, vocabularies, business glossary or terminology,
  or pipeline management.
- Specific use cases are being implemented with specialist teams for the
  pilot initiative.

### Technology

- Technology strategy is focused on experimentation and innovation.
- Manual data transformation and targeted ETL is underway for the pilot.
- Limited infrastructure and dedicated efforts to build initial
  knowledge graph components.

## Level 2

- The domain of parallel knowledge graph activities, 
  implementing multiple (related) use cases on the same platform.
- The organization is creating reusable architecture---i.e. 
  "the EKG platform" ([EKG/Platform](https://method.ekgf.org/vocab/ekg-platform/))---based
  on [EKG principles](https://principles.ekgf.org/principle/).
- The "EKG Center of Excellence" (CoE) is created.
- Funding is likely to be at the LOB level and starts to (partly)
  come from BAU budgets.

### Business

- Stakeholders adopt a “knowledge-centric” mindset in their tactics to 
  strengthen focus on strategic business value.
- Management elevates the knowledge graph as an organizational and 
  funding priority.

### Organization

- An operating model of collaboration is implemented to support 
  the knowledge graph.
- The Center of Excellence and DataOps environment is initiated.
- Budget and implementation strategy are based on agile and
  synchronized with the use case tree methodology.

### Data

- Critical data elements are prioritized in the ontology.
- Approach to identity and meaning resolution is established.
- Use case trees are defined and modeled to capture shared data relationships.
- The knowledge graph is becoming the central point for integration.

### Technology

- Reusable architecture based on EKG Principles
- Core software development design approaches are being established and
  incorporated into strategy. 
- CTO focuses on extending pilot initiatives for additional leverage.

## Level 3

- The establishment of a secure, scalable and resilient 
  [EKG/Platform](https://method.ekgf.org/vocab/ekg-platform/)
  for business-critical strategic use cases. 
- Resources for the design and build of operational systems are defined 
  and coordinated. 
- The knowledge graph is now really an <ins>Enterprise</ins> 
  Knowledge Graph (EKG) that serves as the **_semantic data mesh_**
  for the organization.
- Ownership, governance, and funding are managed at the enterprise level and 
  coordinated by the EKG Center of Excellence that oversees the full 
  life-cycle of use cases from inception to deployment and beyond.
- Long-term "operate \& optimize" processes are in place.

### Business

- Strong collaboration between various business and support units to
  prioritize strategic business cases. 

### Organization

- The EKG is recognized as a core service for the enterprise. 
- Enterprise-wide ownership and funding processes are operational. 
- The EKG Center of Excellence is a stand-alone \gls{bau} department.
  
### Data

- Inventory is embedded into the EKG and linked to governance.
- Data is expressed as formal ontologies, onboarded into the EKG and searchable.
- Data flows are defined and modeled. 
- The EKG is the authoritative source for data.
  
### Technology

- Commitment to the EKG as the strategic infrastructure for the organization.
- Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC), DevOps/GitOps and full continuous deployment 
  are adopted and implemented.
- Cloud architecture defined for elasticity. 
- Data point level entitlement enforcement processes are implemented.

## Level 4

- The EKG is understood as strategic infrastructure---as an operational 
  utility---for the organization and the authoritative source for most data
  (except for data that originates from core legacy systems).
- It supports structural application rationalization that can take over many 
  tasks from humans and process automation. 
- Strategic funding is based on the vision of executive management and 
  fully embraced by the Board of Directors. 
- All core data management capabilities have been achieved.

## Level 5

- The EKG is central to systems and business processes. 
- It has been fully integrated into both internal operations and 
  external supply chain partners. 
- Workflows and approval steps are fully automated. 
- Entitlements and access rights are controlled by the EKG. 
- Inference and reasoning capabilities are used for advanced AI use cases.
