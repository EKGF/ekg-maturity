# Customer Assets

We can generate the documentation for each of our customers using
their logo's, fonts, house-style and IP statement.

For that to work you create a subdirectory under this directory
with the "customer code" such as:

- [agnos](./agnos) (which is the default)
- [ekgf](./ekgf)

## Special Files

- `customer-code-in-file-names.txt`
  You can add this file in a sub-directory if you want to override
  the customer code that needs to be used in the generated output
  files. For instance customer code `agnos` should become `agnos.ai`
  in the file names and `ekgf` should become `EKGF`
