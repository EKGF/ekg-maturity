    In the context of developing use cases in an EKG, the product owner plays a 
    crucial role in ensuring the success of the project. 
    They are responsible for understanding and communicating the needs of the stakeholders, 
    prioritizing requirements, and guiding the development team to create a solution 
    that meets the business objectives. 
    The product owner also ensures that the problem context is well-defined and 
    structured methodically, preferably using a structured method (such as the 
    [EKGF Method](https://method.ekgf.org) which provides a structure of all use cases in an EKG) 
    and that it includes all the [use case requirements](https://maturity.ekgf.org/pillar/organization/use-case-requirements/). 
    Through their leadership, the product owner ensures that the use cases are 
    delivered on time, on budget, and to the satisfaction of the stakeholders.

    In the context of an Enterprise Knowledge Graph (EKG), organizational culture refers to the shared values,
    beliefs, behaviors, and norms that shape the way an organization operates and interacts with its employees,
    customers, and stakeholders.
    
    It represents the collective mindset and character of the organization, influencing its decision-making 
    processes, communication patterns, and overall work environment.
    
    The EKG, as a comprehensive knowledge repository, can capture and represent various aspects of 
    organizational culture. 
    It can include explicit information about the organization's mission, vision, and core values, 
    as well as its preferred work practices, management styles, and communication channels. 
    The EKG can also capture implicit cultural elements, such as employee attitudes, team dynamics, 
    and historical patterns of behavior.
