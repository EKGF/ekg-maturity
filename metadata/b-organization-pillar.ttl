    In the context of developing use cases in an EKG, the product owner plays a 
    crucial role in ensuring the success of the project. 
    They are responsible for understanding and communicating the needs of the stakeholders, 
    prioritizing requirements, and guiding the development team to create a solution 
    that meets the business objectives. 
    The product owner also ensures that the problem context is well-defined and 
    structured methodically, preferably using a structured method (such as the 
    [EKGF Method](https://method.ekgf.org) which provides a structure of all use cases in an EKG) 
    and that it includes all the [use case requirements](use-case-requirements/). 
    Through their leadership, the product owner ensures that the use cases are 
    delivered on time, on budget, and to the satisfaction of the stakeholders.
