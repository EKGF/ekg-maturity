    Data quality is a measurement of the degree to which any dataset is fit for its intended purpose.
    It is based on an understanding of application requirements and derived by reverse engineering of the
    data production process.
    A data quality framework is an agreed methodology including operational controls, governance processes and
    measurement mechanisms.
    The framework is designed to support organizational priorities for data quality based on criticality and business value.
    
    Data Quality business rules ensure that the data is fit for its intended purpose.
    SMEs specify the criteria used to validate and enforce data integrity.
    The criteria are translated into agreed specifications (i.e. business rules) which are later codified for
    data profiling or measuring conformity.
    Data quality business rules can also be embedded into data capture systems to ensure validity at source.
