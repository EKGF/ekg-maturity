Linking data inventory to the knowledge graph (and business concepts) ensures the precision of meaning at the most

Data in the knowledge graph is traceable to all application usage allowing users to find data of interest through
assisted and contextual search and navigation.
The unique ability of the knowledge graph to connect data with metadata enables users to perform flexible queries
in ways that were not previously possible.
