Data integration is challenging because data from multiple sources can have different file formats, data structures,
definitions, and contextual meanings.
Using the \gls{ekg} during data integration standardizes the meaning of data and makes the content understandable
to both humans and machines.
Embedding \iindex{referenceable meaning} into the data using machine-readable standards facilitates
automatic validation and assurance of data quality\index{data!quality}.
Registering data integration activities into the \gls{ekg} generates full data transparency across
linked processes.\index{lineage}\index{data!lineage}
Finally, ontology-based metadata representations make it possible to embed business rules and accommodate
different values, identities, and definitions that existed at various times in the entity lifecycle.
