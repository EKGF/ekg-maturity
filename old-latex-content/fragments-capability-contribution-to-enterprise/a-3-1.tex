% A.3.1 Operating Model -- Contribution to the Enterprise
%
The operating model\index{business!operating model} could help organizations define their requirements
and expectations in terms of standardization and integration across business units.
This would be useful to harmonize business capabilities and glossaries\index{glossary}
across companies and their business units.

Furthermore, an operating model may serve as input to the development of an Enterprise Architecture\index{enterprise architecture}
(see~\ref{sec:ekg-maturity-enterprise-architecture}) that serves as the organizing logic for business processes
and IT infrastructure based on the companyâ€™s standardization and integration requirements.
