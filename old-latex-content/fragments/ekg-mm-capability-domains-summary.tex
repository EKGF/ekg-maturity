\index{capability domain}
All capabilities that we measure and assess in the \gls{ekgmm}\footnote{See \autocite{ekgmm}} are categorized
in four major categories\,---\,also called "pillars"\,---\,that match the four primary audiences that are involved:
\index{audience}

The Business (Strategy)\index{strategy!business strategy} is leading.
In the Business Pillar we discuss (and assess) our capabilities to formulate what our business identity is,
our strategy actuation and elaboration and how that relates to business enablers and to the \gls{ekg}.
The other three pillars are facilitating but in a "Data-centric"\index{data!centric} and ultimately fully model-driven
organization, business strategy gets translated to data strategy~\nameref{ch:ekg-maturity-data-strategy}\index{data!strategy}
and technology strategy gets derived from both.
The organization pillar discusses all capabilities that need to be in place to actually get all these strategies
executed, with the right planning, budgets, processes and workforce.

\index{strategy!business strategy}
\index{strategy!data strategy}
\index{strategy!technology strategy}
\index{strategy!organization strategy}

These four pillars roughly correspond with the four primary audiences that we are addressing:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The audience of people on the business-side
    \item The audience of people that are project managers, trainers or HR, legal, compliance and finance departments
    \item The audience of people in the data-management and data-governance departments
    \item The audience of technologists
\end{enumerate}
