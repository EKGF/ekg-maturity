% C.3.3 Data Quality Execution -- Summary
%
Implementation of the data quality program\index{data!quality!program} is a control process mechanism for organizations.
\index{control process}
It is driven by the execution of business rules at the point of data capture (validation).\improve{%
    JAG>Actually it shouldn't be done just after data capture. First convert raw source data to RDF, then transform%
    to all the relevant ontologies and then run any business rules for curation or enrichment purposes. And for datasets
    where the EKG itself is authoritative we need to run the business rules during a transaction.}
Key components include data profiling, root cause analysis, data remediation and issue management.
The primary objective of the data quality program is to accurately and consistently represent the concepts and
values needed to meet the needs of consumers.
A well-orchestrated data quality program requires communication and operational coordination across the
organizational landscape.
