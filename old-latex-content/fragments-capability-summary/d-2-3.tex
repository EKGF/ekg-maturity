    JAG>We may want to call this "EKG Architecture", unless we want to make this about more than just
    the (technical) architecture of the EKG itself. It could be that all architecture of the whole
    technology landscape could be covered by this capability, at "level 5" I'd say that should be the case anyway.
    At level 1 this capability is however "just" about the architecture of your own EKG.%
