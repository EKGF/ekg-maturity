%
Since an operating model reflects the business needs for standardization across a company and its business units,
it could be a great input for the development of reusable business vocabularies as part of the data infrastructure
of an company as later explained in the data part of this work.
These vocabularies may, in turn, be converted to machine-readable models.
Such machine-readable models are called ontologies.\index{ontology}
