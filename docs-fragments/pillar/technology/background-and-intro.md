# Background & Intro

## Business Continuity

The **Business Continuity** capability within the Technology Pillar focuses on ensuring 
the uninterrupted operation and availability of the Enterprise Knowledge Graph (EKG), 
particularly leveraging the EKG itself at higher levels of maturity. 
It encompasses strategies, processes, and technologies to mitigate risks, 
maintain operational resilience, and enable prompt recovery in the face of 
unexpected events or disruptions.

Key aspects of the Business Continuity capability, driven by the EKG at higher levels of
maturity, include:

1. **Risk Assessment and Planning**: Conducting comprehensive risk assessments to 
   identify potential threats and vulnerabilities to the EKG ecosystem. 
   This involves evaluating various scenarios and leveraging the EKG's interconnected 
   knowledge assets to inform risk mitigation strategies and continuity planning.

2. **Data Backup and Recovery**: Establishing reliable data backup mechanisms powered 
   by the EKG, ensuring the preservation and recoverability of critical EKG data in 
   the event of system failures or data loss.
   The EKG's ability to capture and organize the interconnected data sources facilitates
   efficient backup and recovery processes.

3. **High Availability and Redundancy**: Leveraging the EKG's capabilities to achieve 
   high availability and redundancy within the EKG infrastructure. 
   This involves implementing redundant components and utilizing the EKG's ability to 
   distribute workload, ensuring continuous access and minimal disruptions even in the
   presence of hardware or software failures.

4. **Disaster Recovery Planning**: Developing comprehensive disaster recovery plans 
   that integrate with the EKG, leveraging its interconnected knowledge to guide the 
   recovery process. 
   This includes defining recovery objectives and utilizing the EKG's data contracts 
   to prioritize recovery efforts and ensure prompt restoration of critical components.

5. **Incident Response and Management**: Leveraging the EKG's capabilities to facilitate
   incident response and management processes. 
   The EKG's ability to provide real-time insights and traceability allows for quick 
   detection, assessment, and mitigation of incidents, enabling organizations to minimize
   downtime and rapidly restore normal operations.

6. **Training and Awareness**: Providing training and awareness programs that incorporate
   the EKG's methodology[^method] and tools for business continuity. 
   This ensures that stakeholders understand how the EKG supports continuity efforts, 
   their roles and responsibilities within the EKG ecosystem, and how to effectively 
   utilize the EKG's capabilities during disruptions.

By integrating business continuity operations with the EKG itself at higher levels of 
maturity, organizations can leverage its interconnected knowledge assets, data contracts, 
and real-time insights to enhance risk management, streamline recovery efforts, 
and minimize the impact of disruptions. 
The EKG's ability to facilitate backup and recovery, ensure high availability and redundancy,
guide disaster recovery planning, support incident response, and provide training and 
awareness contributes to a resilient and continuous operation of the EKG ecosystem.
