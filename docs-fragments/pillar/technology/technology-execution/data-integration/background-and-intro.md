Data Integration within the Technology Pillar encompasses the organizational 
capability to seamlessly combine data from various sources into the 
Enterprise Knowledge Graph (EKG). 
It involves the processes, technologies, and practices required to efficiently 
integrate data and resolve identity challenges, including legacy and EKG identifiers.

Key aspects of Data Integration within the Technology Pillar now include:

1. **Data Source Connectivity**: Establishing connections and interfaces to 
   retrieve data from diverse sources, including internal databases,
   external systems, APIs, structured data, unstructured documents, and more. 
   This includes the integration of data with different identifier schemes.
2. **Identity Resolution**: Resolving identity challenges, including legacy 
   identifiers and EKG identifiers, to ensure consistency and accuracy within 
   the EKG. This involves mapping and aligning identifiers across various 
   data sources and resolving conflicts to achieve a unified and reliable 
   representation of entities. 
   See also [D.2.1. Identifier Resolution](../identity-resolution/index.md).
2. **Data Transformation and Harmonization**: Applying transformation and 
   harmonization techniques to ensure data from different sources, including
   legacy systems, are integrated and reconciled effectively within the EKG. 
   This includes mapping legacy identifiers to EKG identifiers and maintaining 
   referential integrity.
3. **Data Quality and Governance**: Implementing data quality measures and 
   governance practices to address identity-related issues. 
   This involves data profiling, deduplication, and data cleansing to improve
   the accuracy, completeness, and reliability of entity identities within the EKG.
4. **Semantic Interoperability**: Achieving semantic interoperability by 
   harmonizing the meaning and representation of entity identities across 
   diverse data sources.
   This involves leveraging ontologies, controlled vocabularies, and 
   semantic modeling techniques to ensure consistency and accurate identity 
   representation within the EKG.
5. **Scalability and Performance**: Ensuring the data integration processes, 
   including identity resolution, can scale to handle increasing volumes of data
   and perform optimally within the EKG ecosystem. 
   This may involve adopting scalable technologies, distributed processing 
   frameworks, and optimizing workflows to address identity resolution 
   challenges at scale.

By incorporating identity resolution into the Data Integration capability, 
organizations can effectively address the challenges associated with legacy 
and EKG identifiers. 
This enables a cohesive and accurate representation of entities within the EKG, 
ensuring data integrity and supporting reliable knowledge discovery, analytics,
and decision-making processes.

## Approach

1. **Use Case-driven Approach**: Emphasizing the importance of defining use cases
   that drive data integration projects. 
   Each use case represents a specific business objective or information need 
   that is modeled within the EKG itself. 
   By identifying these use cases upfront, organizations can establish a 
   clear understanding of "the why" behind data integration efforts.
2. **Use Case Modeling and Linkage**: Assigning an EKG identifier to each use case
   and establishing linkages between the use case and the relevant data sources, 
   data products, and other related entities within the EKG. 
   This ensures that everything associated with or serving a specific use case
   is properly connected and traceable.
3. **Alignment with Business Objectives**: Ensuring that data integration projects
   are aligned with the broader business objectives and strategic initiatives 
   of the organization. 
   By explicitly linking data integration efforts to specific use cases, 
   organizations can prioritize and allocate resources effectively, 
   focusing on the most critical areas that drive value and address business needs.
4. **Continuous Refinement and Adaptation**: Recognizing that use cases and 
   their associated data integration projects may evolve over time. 
   It is essential to adopt an iterative and agile approach, allowing for 
   continuous refinement and adaptation of the EKG's data integration strategies
   based on changing business requirements and emerging use cases.
5. **Documentation and Communication**: Documenting the rationale, scope, and 
   objectives of each use case and data integration project, and effectively 
   communicating this information to relevant stakeholders. 
   This ensures a shared understanding of "the why" behind the data integration 
   efforts and facilitates collaboration, decision-making, and alignment 
   across the organization.

By adopting a use case-driven approach (see [EKG Method](https://method.ekgf.org)
and clearly linking data integration projects to specific use cases within the EKG,
organizations can establish a strong foundation for data integration initiatives. 
This enables focused, purposeful, and traceable data integration efforts, 
ensuring that the right data is integrated for the right reasons, driving value, 
and supporting informed decision-making and knowledge discovery within the organization.
