The _Operations capability_ within the Technology Pillar addresses the deployment and
maintenance requirements for the EKG.
It encompasses the processes, practices, and infrastructure necessary to ensure the
smooth and efficient operation of the EKG throughout its lifecycle.

Key aspects of a unified Operations capability (which in itself is a high-level
use case with sub-use cases[^method]) include:

1. **Deployment Management:** Planning and executing the deployment of the EKG,
   including infrastructure provisioning, software installation, configuration,
   and integration with existing systems.
   This involves establishing deployment standards, documentation, and best practices
   to ensure a consistent and reliable deployment process.

2. **Monitoring and Performance Optimization:** Implementing monitoring tools and
   techniques to proactively track the health, performance, and usage of the EKG.
   This includes monitoring key metrics, identifying bottlenecks or issues,
   and optimizing the performance to ensure the EKG meets the organization's needs.

3. **Security and Access Control:** Implementing security measures to protect the
   EKG from unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security risks.
   This involves defining access control policies, encryption mechanisms,
   authentication methods, and auditing processes to safeguard sensitive data and
   maintain compliance with relevant regulations.

4. **Backup and Recovery:** Establishing backup and recovery mechanisms to ensure
   the resilience and availability of the EKG.
   This includes regular data backups, disaster recovery planning, and testing of
   recovery procedures to minimize data loss and downtime in the event of
   system failures or disruptions.

5. **Change Management:** Implementing change management processes to effectively
   handle updates, upgrades, and modifications to the EKG.
   This involves maintaining a change log, assessing the impact of changes,
   and ensuring proper communication and coordination with stakeholders to
   minimize disruptions and maintain the integrity of the EKG.

6. **Governance and Compliance:** Establishing governance frameworks and
   compliance processes to ensure the EKG adheres to relevant policies,
   standards, and regulations.
   This includes data governance, data lifecycle management, metadata management,
   and adherence to industry best practices.

Additionally, the Operations capability itself generates valuable operational data,
such as deployment information and performance metrics, that can be integrated into the EKG.
At higher levels of maturity, organizations can automate and streamline the operational side
of the EKG by leveraging this data within the graph.
This allows for higher levels of automation, efficient decision-making, and
proactive management of the EKG's operational aspects.

By focusing on the Operations capability and integrating operational data into the EKG,
organizations can effectively manage the deployment and maintenance of the EKG,
ensuring its reliable operation and availability.
This capability helps organizations leverage the full potential of the EKG and provides
a solid foundation for knowledge management, decision-making, and collaboration within the organization.
