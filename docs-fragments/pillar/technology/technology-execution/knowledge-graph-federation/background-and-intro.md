The Knowledge Graph Federation capability is vital for integrating distributed
data sources in a federated knowledge graph.

Two key aspects are crucial for its implementation:

1. **Authoritative Identifier Resolution:** Establishing an authoritative approach
   for identifier resolution is essential. 
   It involves defining a consistent strategy to resolve identifiers across the 
   federated data sources. 
   This ensures data integrity, eliminates conflicts, and enables accurate 
   cross-referencing and integration of data.

2. **Meaning Understanding and Policy Integration:** Understanding the meaning 
   and policies associated with identified objects is critical. 
   This involves capturing metadata, semantics, and contextual information to gain
   a comprehensive understanding of object attributes and relationships. 
   By integrating policy management and entitlements, organizations can enforce 
   access controls, data governance, and compliance across the federated 
   knowledge graph.

By implementing an authoritative identifier resolution strategy and integrating 
meaning understanding and policy integration, organizations can enable effective 
knowledge graph federation.
This allows for seamless data integration, collaboration, and decision-making
across distributed sources while ensuring data integrity, security, and compliance.
