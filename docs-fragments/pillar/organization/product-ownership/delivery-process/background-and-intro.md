Delivery process is a mature capability that an organization needs to have in place. 
It involves a well-defined process for developing and delivering products, services,
or solutions that meet the needs of customers and stakeholders. 
This process typically includes a project management framework, with well-defined roles, 
responsibilities, and deliverables. It also includes quality assurance and testing, 
with a focus on delivering a high-quality end product. 
In the context of an EKG, the delivery process also involves ensuring that the use cases 
are properly implemented, integrated, and tested across the entire ecosystem, 
and that they adhere to the principles and standards of the EKG framework. 
This requires a well-coordinated effort across the organization, 
with effective communication and collaboration between different teams and stakeholders.
