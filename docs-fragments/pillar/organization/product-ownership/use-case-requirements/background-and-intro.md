Use cases are essentially representations of information demand,
capturing the specific needs of various business functions or processes within an organization.
They should be modeled in a way that is as independent as possible from the supply-side details,
meaning the specifics of the [semantic data products](data-product.ekgf.org) and the semantic model
used to fulfill the demand.
When viewed from the demand-side perspective, an EKG enables an organization to identify
the most important and valuable use cases for its business and to prioritize them accordingly.
By understanding the context of these use cases and the specific requirements they entail,
the organization can make better decisions around data management and prioritize investments
in the EKG infrastructure to best support these demands.
