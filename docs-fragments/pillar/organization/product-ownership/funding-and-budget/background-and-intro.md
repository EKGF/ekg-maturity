In the context of an EKG, the funding and budget capability is different than that 
of traditional siloed solutions. 
With siloed solutions, funding and budgeting are directly related to solving a 
given problem, usually short-term. 
However, in the EKG context, there is a major distinction. 
The separation of "demand and supply" of information allows for much higher levels 
of reuse and flexibility of use cases, with a much broader usage of each use case 
and potentially more stakeholders per use case. 
This means that funding and budgeting must be approached with a more strategic 
and long-term view, as each use case can have a much wider impact on the organization. 
Therefore, the funding and budget capability in the context of an EKG is crucial 
for the success of the overall information strategy, 
and should be aligned with the organization's long-term goals and objectives.
