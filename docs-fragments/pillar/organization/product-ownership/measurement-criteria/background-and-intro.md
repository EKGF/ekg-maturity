The measurement criteria capability focuses on defining and implementing 
metrics and criteria to evaluate the effectiveness and success of the EKG. 
This includes both business metrics, such as ROI, customer satisfaction, 
and time to market, as well as technical metrics, such as data quality, 
system availability, and response time. 
The measurement criteria capability also involves establishing benchmarks 
and targets for each metric, monitoring and analyzing the data to identify 
areas for improvement, and continuously refining the metrics and criteria 
based on feedback and changing business needs. 
This capability is essential for ensuring that the EKG is meeting its 
objectives and delivering value to the organization.
