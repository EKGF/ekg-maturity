_Control Functions_ are essential capabilities that organizations need to establish 
when operating and developing an Enterprise Knowledge Graph at higher levels of 
maturity. 
These functions enable effective control, management, and governance of the 
knowledge graph to ensure its integrity, security, and optimal utilization.

Key aspects of the capability _Control Functions_ in the context of an EKG include:

1. **Data Governance**: Establishing robust data governance practices to ensure data
   quality, integrity, privacy, and compliance with regulations. 
   This involves defining data policies, roles, responsibilities, and processes for
   data management within the knowledge graph.
2. **Access Control**: Implementing measures to control access to the knowledge graph,
   ensuring that only authorized individuals or roles have appropriate access 
   permissions. 
   This helps protect sensitive information and prevent unauthorized use or 
   modifications.
3. **Security and Privacy**: Implementing security measures to protect the knowledge 
   graph from unauthorized access, data breaches, and cyber threats. 
   Additionally, ensuring compliance with privacy regulations and protecting personally
   identifiable information (PII) within the knowledge graph.
4. **Versioning and Change Control**: Establishing processes and controls for 
   versioning and change management within the knowledge graph. 
   This includes tracking changes, maintaining historical versions, and ensuring 
   proper documentation of modifications made to the graph's structure and data.
5. **Audit and Compliance**: Conducting regular audits to ensure compliance with 
   internal policies, regulatory requirements, and industry standards. 
   This helps identify any gaps or non-compliance issues within the knowledge graph
   and enables corrective actions.
6. **Monitoring and Performance Optimization**: Implementing monitoring mechanisms to
   track the performance and usage of the knowledge graph. 
   This helps identify bottlenecks, optimize performance, and ensure the
   graph's responsiveness to meet user needs.
7. **Risk Management**: Identifying and managing risks associated with the 
   knowledge graph, such as data integrity issues, system vulnerabilities, 
   or dependencies on external data sources. 
   Implementing risk mitigation strategies to minimize potential disruptions and
   ensure the reliability of the knowledge graph.

By establishing these control functions, organizations can maintain the stability,
security, and effectiveness of their Enterprise Knowledge Graph as it operates 
and evolves at higher levels of maturity.
