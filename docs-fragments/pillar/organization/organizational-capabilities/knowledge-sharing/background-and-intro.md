_Knowledge Sharing_ is the ability of the organization to facilitate effective 
collaboration and exchange of knowledge among employees. 

It involves creating a culture of collaboration, leveraging the 
Enterprise Knowledge Graph as a centralized source of knowledge, 
defining proper KPIs and KRIs around a method-based approach to knowledge sharing,
involving key personas such as subject matter experts (SMEs) and relevant stakeholders,
supporting learning initiatives, recognizing and incentivizing knowledge sharing, 
establishing communities of practice, and implementing governance. 
Through Knowledge Sharing, organizations tap into collective expertise, drive innovation,
improve decision-making, and enhance overall performance, ensuring that all the right
personas and stakeholders are part of the knowledge sharing process.
