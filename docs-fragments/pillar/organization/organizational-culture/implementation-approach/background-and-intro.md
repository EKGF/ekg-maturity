The _Implementation Approach capability_ within the "Organizational Culture" 
capability area aims to establish a culture that extends to trusted vendors 
and encompasses a clear understanding of the overall information economy. 
This includes having a structured view of demand (use cases) and supply (data products)
and the data contracts that connect them. 
Key to this approach is ensuring that each use case and data product is well-defined
with a clear scope, objectives, responsibilities, expectations, and a strategic roadmap.
This enables the organization to achieve reuse and repurpose at an ecosystem scale.

Key aspects of the Implementation Approach capability include:

1. **Structured View of Demand and Supply**: Developing a structured understanding of
   the overall information economy, with a clear delineation of the demand for 
   information (use cases) and the supply of information (data products). 
   This provides a comprehensive perspective on the organization's knowledge needs
   and available data assets.
2. **Clear Use Case and Data Product Definition**: Ensuring that each use case and
   data product is well-defined, with a clear scope, objectives, and expected outcomes.
   This involves articulating the responsibilities and expectations of all stakeholders
   involved and providing a strategic roadmap that aligns with the organization's goals.
3. **Collaboration at Ecosystem Scale**: Fostering collaboration and facilitating reuse
   and repurpose of resources at the ecosystem scale. 
   This involves creating an environment where use cases and data products can be shared,
   adapted, and built upon, allowing for increased efficiency, innovation, 
   and scalability.
4. **Strategic Roadmap Alignment**: Ensuring that the implementation approach aligns
   with the strategic roadmap of the organization. 
   This involves integrating the goals, milestones, and priorities of the EKG development
   and operation into the broader strategic initiatives of the organization, 
   promoting synergy and a unified direction.
5. **Ecosystem-wide Responsibility**: Promoting a culture of shared responsibility and
   accountability across the ecosystem. 
   This includes establishing clear roles and responsibilities for all stakeholders
   involved in the development, operation, and utilization of the EKG, ensuring 
   effective coordination and collaboration.

By adopting an implementation approach that includes a structured view of demand and 
supply, well-defined use cases and data products, and a focus on ecosystem-wide reuse 
and repurpose, organizations can foster a culture of efficiency, innovation, 
and strategic alignment. 
This enables the organization to effectively leverage its knowledge assets, 
drive value creation, and achieve higher levels of maturity for the 
Enterprise Knowledge Graph.
