# Introduction & Background

## Organizational Culture

In the context of an Enterprise Knowledge Graph (EKG), organizational culture refers to the shared values,
beliefs, behaviors, and norms that shape the way an organization operates and interacts with its employees,
customers, and stakeholders.
It represents the collective mindset and character of the organization, influencing its decision-making processes,
communication patterns, and overall work environment.

Organizational Culture is relevant for the EKG in two ways:

1. [Organizational Culture contributes to the EKG](#organizational-culture-contributes-to-the-ekg)
2. [EKG contributes to the Organizational Culture](#ekg-contributes-to-the-organizational-culture)

[Organizational Culture](../organizational-culture) is further documented in this maturity model as its
own capability area with the following three capabilities that are relevant to the EKG:

1. [B.4.1. Implementation Approach](../organizational-culture/implementation-approach)
2. [B.4.2. Agility & Innovation](../organizational-culture/agility-and-innovation)
3. [B.4.3. Ecosystem Collaboration](../organizational-culture/ecosystem-collaboration)

### Organizational Culture contributes to the EKG

In order to establish higher levels of maturity of the EKG, certain cultural capabilities need to be
in place.

By identifying and understanding these major components, organizations can create a strong foundation for
scaling the EKG to its highest levels of maturity. 
This comprehensive understanding enables effective integration, collaboration, and knowledge sharing 
within the organization, maximizing the potential of the EKG and fostering a knowledge-based economy.
 
### EKG contributes to the Organizational Culture

The EKG, as a comprehensive knowledge repository, can capture and represent various aspects of 
organizational culture. 
It can include explicit information about the organization's mission, vision, and core values, 
as well as its preferred work practices, management styles, and communication channels. 
The EKG can also capture implicit cultural elements, such as employee attitudes, team dynamics, 
and historical patterns of behavior.

By incorporating organizational culture into the EKG, an organization can benefit in several ways:

1. **Knowledge Sharing and Collaboration**: The EKG can provide a platform for employees to share their 
   experiences, best practices, and insights related to the organization's culture. 
   It can facilitate collaboration and foster a sense of community among employees, 
   enabling them to align their actions with the shared values and goals.
2. **Onboarding and Training**: The EKG can serve as a valuable resource during the onboarding process for 
   new employees. It can provide them with information about the organization's culture, 
   helping them understand the expected behaviors, norms, and values. 
   Additionally, the EKG can offer training materials and resources that support cultural assimilation 
   and professional development.
3. **Decision-making and Strategy**: The EKG can aid decision-making processes by providing access to 
   cultural data and insights. 
   Leaders and managers can leverage this information to align strategies, initiatives, and policies with 
   the organization's culture, ensuring consistency and reinforcing desired behaviors across the organization.
4. **Change Management**: During times of organizational change, the EKG can play a crucial role in managing
   cultural transitions. 
   It can document the current and desired culture, identify gaps, and track progress. 
   The EKG can also provide a platform for employees to express their concerns, suggestions, and feedback, 
   facilitating a transparent and inclusive change management process.
5. **Organizational Learning**: The EKG can support organizational learning by capturing lessons learned, 
   success stories, and failures related to the organization's culture. 
   It can help identify patterns, trends, and areas for improvement, enabling the organization to adapt 
   and evolve its culture over time.

In summary, organizational culture within the context of an Enterprise Knowledge Graph refers to the 
collective beliefs, values, and behaviors that shape an organization. 
By integrating cultural elements into the EKG, organizations can leverage this knowledge to enhance collaboration, 
guide decision-making, support change management, and foster a positive and productive work environment.

## Data Economy

At the highest levels of maturity of an enterprise's EKG, the EKG can serve as an enabler
for a knowledge-based economy or data economy. 
In this context, the EKG acts as a bridge between the demand for information (use cases) and the 
supply of information (data publishers and their [data products](https://data-product.ekgf.org)). 
It facilitates the efficient discovery, access, and utilization of relevant knowledge within an organization.

Here's how the EKG enables a Data Economy:

1. **Demand for Information (Use Cases)**: In a knowledge-based economy, there is a constant demand 
   for information to support various business needs, decision-making processes, innovation, 
   and problem-solving. Use cases represent these demands, which can range from answering specific
   questions to developing insights, conducting research, or creating new products and services.
2. **Supply of Information (Data Publishers and Data Products)**: The EKG brings together 
   data publishers, who generate, curate, and maintain data assets within the organization. 
   These data assets can include structured data, unstructured documents, domain-specific knowledge, 
   external data sources, and more. Data publishers contribute to the EKG by organizing and 
   structuring their data in a way that is compatible with the graph model.
3. **Linking Demand and Supply**: The EKG acts as a central hub that links the demand for 
   information (use cases) with the supply of information (data publishers and their data 
   products). 
   It provides a framework for organizing and connecting the knowledge within the organization, 
   making it discoverable and accessible to users who have specific information needs.
4. **Efficient Information Discovery**: The EKG enables users to discover relevant information
   by leveraging graph-based search capabilities. 
   Users can navigate through the interconnected nodes and relationships of the graph, exploring
   and uncovering relevant data sources, insights, and knowledge assets that address their 
   specific use cases.
5. **Data Product Marketplace**: In a mature EKG, the supply of information can be treated as a 
   marketplace of [data products](https://data-product.ekgf.org). 
   Data publishers can package their data and knowledge assets into consumable data products 
   that are easily discoverable and accessible through the EKG. 
   Users can browse these data products, understand their contents, and request access to the
   relevant ones to fulfill their information needs.
6. **Value Creation**: By effectively linking the demand and supply of information, the EKG 
   facilitates value creation within the organization.
   Users can leverage the available knowledge and data assets to make informed decisions, 
   drive innovation, improve operational efficiency, and gain competitive advantages in the
   data economy.

In summary, at the highest levels of maturity, an EKG acts as an 
enabler for a data economy by connecting the demand for information (use cases) to the 
supply of information (data publishers and their [data products](https://data-product.ekgf.org)). 
It promotes efficient information discovery, facilitates the creation of value, and empowers 
organizations to leverage their knowledge assets effectively.

## Highest levels of Maturity

In order to achieve the highest levels of maturity in an EKG), it is crucial for the organization
to be able to identify and understand all the major components that contribute to the knowledge 
ecosystem. 

At the highest levels of maturity, it is essential for the organization to have a comprehensive 
understanding of the major components that form the foundation of the EKG. 
This includes identifying and defining the key entities such as people, places, departments, 
[data products](https://data-product.ekgf.org), use cases, and the connecting data contracts 
that facilitate the exchange of information.

1. **People**: Identifying the individuals and roles within the organization is essential for 
   establishing a comprehensive EKG. Understanding the expertise, responsibilities, and 
   contributions of employees helps determine the knowledge holders and potential collaborators 
   who can contribute to the EKG.
2. **Places**: Identifying the physical locations, organizational units, and virtual spaces is 
   important for capturing the context and relevance of the knowledge within the EKG.
   It helps establish the spatial relationships and organizational structure that influence the 
   flow of information. 
3. **Departments**: Identifying the various departments or functional units within the organization 
   allows for a better understanding of the specific knowledge domains and subject areas that exist.
   This helps organize and categorize the knowledge assets within the EKG and enables effective 
   collaboration and information exchange across departments.
4. **Data Products**: Identifying and cataloging the data products available within the organization
   is crucial for a mature EKG. This includes structured data, unstructured documents, 
   analytical models, ontologies, and other knowledge representations
   Understanding the content, format, and availability of data products ensures their proper 
   integration and utilization within the EKG.
5. **Use Cases**[^method]: Identifying and defining the use cases or information needs of the organization 
   is essential for aligning the EKG with business requirements. 
   By understanding the specific questions, challenges, and objectives, the EKG can be tailored to
   address these use cases effectively and provide the necessary knowledge support. 
6. **Data Contracts**: Identifying and establishing data contracts or agreements between data 
   publishers and users is fundamental for the EKG's scalability and success. 
   These contracts outline the terms, specifications, and expectations for sharing and accessing 
   data products within the graph. 
   They define the rights, responsibilities, and quality requirements to ensure reliable and
   consistent knowledge exchange.

By identifying and understanding these major components, organizations can create a strong foundation
for scaling the EKG to its highest levels of maturity. 
This comprehensive understanding enables effective integration, collaboration, and knowledge sharing 
within the organization, maximizing the potential of the EKG and fostering a knowledge-based economy.
