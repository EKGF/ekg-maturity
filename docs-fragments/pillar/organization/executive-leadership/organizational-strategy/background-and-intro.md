To develop an effective EKG-based organizational strategy, leaders need to focus on several key areas. 

First, they must identify the organization's business capabilities, which map to the components of the business. 
These capabilities can be increased through mergers, acquisitions, or joint ventures. 
Leaders must also assess the external environment, including market trends, competitor activity, 
and regulatory changes, to determine how best to position the organization for success.

As part of the wider business strategy, the organization should select a number of strategic 
[purposeful business themes](https://principles.ekgf.org/theme/) such as 
[Transparency](https://principles.ekgf.org/theme/transparency/),
[Accountability](https://principles.ekgf.org/theme/accountability/),
[Digital Assets](https://principles.ekgf.org/theme/digital-assets/) or
[Composable Business](https://principles.ekgf.org/theme/composable-business/),
that drive all further decision-making for a given period of time. 
These themes are high-level concepts that align with the organization's overall mission and provide 
a clear direction for its data-centric initiatives.

Once the business capabilities are identified, it's important to translate them into
[use cases](https://method.ekgf.org/concept/use-case/) that can drive business value. 
This is where the [Use Case Tree (UCT) format](https://method.ekgf.org/concept/use-case-tree/)
comes in. 
The UCT is a tree-like structure that organizes the identified use cases into a hierarchy, 
allowing for a clear understanding of how each use case contributes to the overall business objectives.

Leaders also need to ensure that the organization has the right mix of talent, technology, 
and processes to execute on its EKG-based strategy effectively. 
This includes investing in training and development programs to help employees acquire 
new data skills and capabilities, as well as adopting agile methodologies and data-driven 
decision-making practices to improve the speed and accuracy of data analysis and delivery.

Furthermore, it is crucial to translate the organization's EKG-based strategy into policies 
that are fully automatable via the EKG. 
For each defined use case, it should be clear which policies are applicable and how they will be
modeled, automated, and enforced in the context of the EKG. 
This helps ensure consistency and compliance across the organization and enables fully
automated digital supply chains.

Finally, leaders need to cultivate a culture of innovation and continuous improvement, 
where employees are encouraged to experiment, take risks, and learn from data-driven insights. 
This requires creating an environment that fosters collaboration, openness, and trust, 
and providing employees with the resources and support they need to innovate and drive change.

Overall, an EKG-based organizational strategy requires a modern data-centric approach that 
considers the interdependencies between data, people, and technology. 
By leveraging the power of an EKG, the [EKGF Method](https://method.ekgf.org), semantic technologies,
[purposeful business themes](https://principles.ekgf.org/theme/), and the concept of composable business[^gartner], organizations can 
unlock the full potential of their business capabilities and position themselves to 
thrive in a rapidly changing business landscape.
