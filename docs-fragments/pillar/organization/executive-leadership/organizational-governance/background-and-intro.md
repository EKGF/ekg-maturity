Organizational governance refers to the set of rules, practices, and processes by which an 
organization is directed and controlled. 
It includes the frameworks and mechanisms for decision-making, accountability, and transparency. 
In the context of an enterprise knowledge graph (EKG) and composable business, 
governance is critical to ensure that the EKG is maintained and managed properly, 
and that the organization operates in compliance with applicable regulations and business policies.

One key aspect of EKG governance is data governance, which involves the management of data assets,
including policies for data quality, security, and privacy. 
The EKG should be designed to enforce these policies and provide transparency into data usage and access.

Another aspect of governance is the establishment of a clear decision-making framework, 
including the roles and responsibilities of different stakeholders in the organization. 
This should include the definition of decision-making criteria, the identification of 
decision-makers, and the establishment of a process for escalation and dispute resolution.

In order to ensure that the EKG is being used effectively and efficiently, governance 
should also include the establishment of performance metrics and monitoring mechanisms. 
This allows the organization to track the usage of the EKG, identify areas for improvement, 
and ensure that the EKG is delivering value to the business.

Overall, effective organizational governance is critical to ensure the success of an EKG and 
composable business strategy, as it provides the structure and processes needed to support 
the ongoing management and use of the EKG.
