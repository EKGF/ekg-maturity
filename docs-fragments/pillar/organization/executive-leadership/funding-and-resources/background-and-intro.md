To achieve the level of product strategy maturity, necessary to continuously 
recompose their business, organizations must prioritize funding for EKG development.
This includes investing in the necessary technology, human resources, 
and ongoing monitoring and evaluation efforts to ensure that the EKG continues 
to provide value and remains relevant in the face of changing business needs and circumstances.
Additionally, the EKG must be designed to be flexible and adaptable, 
enabling the organization to easily recompose their business via mergers, 
acquisitions, joint-ventures, and reorganizations without disrupting operations 
or losing critical knowledge and customer loyalty.
By prioritizing strategic funding for EKG development and taking a proactive approach 
to business recomposition, organizations can position themselves for long-term success 
in today's rapidly changing business environment.
