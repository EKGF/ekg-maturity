Organizational policies, including both business policies and applicable regulations, 
play a critical role in guiding an enterprise's decision-making processes. 
With the rise of EKG as a powerful tool for managing data and business processes,
it becomes increasingly important to ensure that these policies are enforced 
in the context of every use case that an EKG operates in. 

More mature enterprises, especially those in highly regulated industries, 
will become "policy-driven organizations," leveraging EKG to facilitate the 
automated enforcement of policies across the entire business. 
These policies can include data governance and management policies, 
such as Entitlement Policies, Data Sovereignty Policies, and Data Lifecycle Policies, 
as well as business policies that define a wide range of parameters, limits, and constraints. 
By translating policies into machine-readable formats and mapping them to specific use cases, 
EKG can help ensure that all relevant policies are enforced consistently and 
automatically across the entire enterprise.
