# Background & Intro

DataOps is a set of practices and principles that are used to improve the 
collaboration, agility, and quality of data-related processes within an organization. 
DataOps focuses on applying the principles and practices of agile and DevOps 
to data management, with the goal of increasing the speed and reliability of data-related processes.

In the context of an Enterprise Knowledge Graph, a DataOps process could involve 
a number of different activities, depending on the specific goals and needs of the
organization. 
Some common activities that may be involved in a DataOps process for an 
Enterprise Knowledge Graph include:

1. Defining and documenting the data governance policies and processes that will
   be used to manage and maintain the Enterprise Knowledge Graph. 
   This may include defining the roles and responsibilities of different teams 
   and individuals, as well as the procedures and tools that will be used to 
   ensure the quality and consistency of the data in the Enterprise Knowledge Graph.
2. Developing and implementing automated processes for extracting, transforming, 
   and loading data into the Enterprise Knowledge Graph.
   This may involve using tools and technologies such as ETL (extract, transform, 
   load) tools, data integration platforms, or data pipelines to automate the 
   process of moving data from different sources into the Enterprise Knowledge Graph.
3. Developing and implementing data quality and data integrity checks to ensure 
   that the data in the Enterprise Knowledge Graph is accurate, consistent,
   and reliable.
   This may involve using tools and techniques such as data profiling, data cleansing,
   or data validation to identify and correct errors or inconsistencies in the data.
4. Developing and implementing tools and interfaces for accessing and querying the
   data in the Enterprise Knowledge Graph. 
   This may involve using technologies such as graph databases, SPARQL, 
   or natural language processing to enable users to interact with the data in the
   Enterprise Knowledge Graph in a meaningful and intuitive way.
5. Monitoring and analyzing the performance and usage of the Enterprise Knowledge Graph,
   to identify opportunities for optimization and improvement. 
   This may involve using tools and techniques such as data analytics, 
   machine learning, or data mining to understand how the Enterprise Knowledge Graph
   is being used, and to identify areas where the data or the system can be improved.
