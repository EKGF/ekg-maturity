The _Ontologies & Mapping capability_ within the Delivery Management area focuses on
organizing and continuously improving ontologies and vocabularies used 
within an organization's knowledge graph. 
It encompasses the management of mappings between these semantic structures and
the knowledge graph's use cases and data sources.

Key aspects of the Ontologies & Mapping capability include:

1. **Ontology Management**: Establishing practices for the creation, maintenance, 
   and enhancement of ontologies and vocabularies. 
   This involves defining governance processes, versioning strategies, 
   and ensuring alignment with industry standards and best practices.

2. **Continuous Improvement**: Encouraging ongoing enhancements and refinements
   to ontologies and vocabularies based on evolving business needs, 
   domain expertise, and feedback from knowledge graph stakeholders.

3. **Mapping Management**: Managing mappings between ontologies or 
   vocabularies, and the knowledge graph's use cases and data sources. 
   This involves identifying and maintaining mappings that establish connections
   and relationships between the various semantic structures and the data 
   represented in the knowledge graph.

4. **Alignment with Use Cases and Data Products**: Ensuring that ontologies, 
   or vocabularies are aligned with the specific use cases and 
   data products within the knowledge graph.
   This includes identifying the relevant concepts, properties, and relationships
   required for effective knowledge graph utilization.

In managing the Ontologies & Mapping capability, the organization pillar personnel,
such as project managers, play a crucial role. 
While improving the ontologies and specialist knowledge may require the expertise 
of domain experts, it is the responsibility of the organization pillar to organize
these efforts effectively. 
This involves:

- **Identifying the right experts**: Engaging domain experts and stakeholders who 
  possess the required knowledge and expertise to improve the ontologies.
- **Organizing collaboration**: Facilitating collaboration between domain experts, 
  project teams, and other stakeholders to ensure the right experts are involved 
  at the right time.
- **Stakeholder commitment**: Securing the commitment and support of senior 
  stakeholders who champion the improvement initiatives, ensuring proper funding
  and mandate for the necessary improvements.
- **Managing production impact**: Considering the potential impact of ontology 
  improvements on existing use cases in production and taking appropriate measures
  to mitigate risks and ensure smooth transitions.

By effectively managing the Ontologies & Mapping capability, the organization pillar
personnel enable the coordination, collaboration, and improvement of ontologies
or vocabularies within the knowledge graph.
They ensure the involvement of the right experts, alignment with business needs, 
and seamless integration with the overall delivery management process. 
Through their efforts, the organization can leverage the semantic richness, 
interoperability, and usability of the knowledge graph to drive valuable insights 
and outcomes.

Note: The capability encompasses the continuous improvement of ontologies or vocabularies,
as well as the management of mappings between these structures and knowledge graph use cases and data sources.
