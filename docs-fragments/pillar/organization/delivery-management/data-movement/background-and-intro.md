The **Data Movement** capability in the Delivery Management area focuses on establishing 
policies and organizing the data supply chains within an organization.
It involves defining and implementing practices related to data product identification, 
ownership, data contracts, and ensuring alignment with use cases.

Key aspects of the Data Movement capability include:

1. **Data Supply Chain Organization:** Establishing well-defined and structured data 
   supply chains that outline the flow of data between use cases and their associated 
   data products.
   This involves identifying data products, their owners, and establishing clear 
   relationships and dependencies between them.

2. **Data Product Identification:** Defining clear guidelines and processes for 
   identifying data products within the organization that are relevant to specific
   use cases. 
   This includes understanding the purpose, scope, and characteristics of 
   each data product, enabling effective management and governance.

3. **Data Contracts:** Establishing data contracts between the parties involved in 
   the data supply chains. These contracts define the rights, responsibilities, 
   and expectations of each party regarding data sharing, access, usage, and security. 
   Clear data contracts ensure transparency, accountability, and compliance throughout 
   the data movement process.

4. **Use Case Alignment:** Identifying relevant use cases and creating a use case tree 
   that provides a structured view of the organization's data requirements. 
   It is crucial to ensure that each use case is properly tied to the appropriate 
   data products via data contracts. 
   This alignment ensures that data movement supports the specific needs of each 
   use case and facilitates effective decision-making and analysis.

By focusing on the policies, organization, and use case alignment within the 
data supply chains, the Data Movement capability enables efficient and effective 
data flow within the organization. 
It ensures that data products are well-managed, stakeholders are aligned, 
and data movement processes adhere to established guidelines, contracts, 
and use case requirements.

*Note: The capability encompasses all data supply chains between use cases and their associated data products, ensuring a comprehensive approach to managing data movement throughout the organization.*
