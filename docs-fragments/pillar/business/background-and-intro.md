# Introduction & Background

The modern economy is often characterized as an Information Economy or 
more specifically, Knowledge Economy, emphasizing the importance of 
knowledge as the key productivity lever and intellectual capital as the
key differentiator of enterprises.
Widespread digitalization over the last two decades has accelerated the
scale, reach and impact of businesses in today’s knowledge economy.
Seven of the top ten firms globally by market capitalization at the 
time of this writing (
Apple,
Amazon,
Microsoft,
Alphabet,
Facebook,
Tencent,
Alibaba),
are representative of this characterization.
This underscores the broad expectation that future competitiveness
is increasingly focused on embedding and capitalizing knowledge in the 
design, delivery and eventual effectiveness of products, services 
and activities in business models of Enterprises.

What does a knowledge-based differentiated focus in products and 
services mean for enterprises?
Prevalent characterization of some business models offers some clue:

**Embedded Finance**

:   The emphasis that convenience of financial products is increasingly
    determined by integrating them seamlessly into non-financial
    applications and processes.
    Embedded Finance offers a new, very large addressable market 
    opportunity worth over $7 trillion in ten years' time,
    twice the combined value of the world’s top 30 banks today.

**Subscription Services**

:   The emphasis that experience of products and services is 
    increasingly determined not from broad contours of use over 
    time but by specific contexts of use at any given time.
    78% of international adults in 2021 have subscription
    services (71% in 2018).
    And 75% believe that in the future, people will subscribe to 
    more services and own less physical "stuff".

**Platform Services**

:   The emphasis that utility of services is increasingly
    determined not from clarity of individual service but through
    convenience of search and similarity of use across a range 
    of related products and services.
    More than 30% of global economic activity---some $60
    trillion---could be mediated by digital platforms

    ...Where we’re going is a future of work with knowledge...
    being created at the pace only possible with one billion workers.
    What does empowering its knowledge workers and embedding knowledge in
    products and services mean for enterprises?

In the following sections, we explore a few illustrative capabilities that
enable enterprises to leverage and embed knowledge in their propositions,
products and services, planning and activities.

## The Business Case for Explorative Execution

Business performance emphasising
financial performance---typically, aspects of revenue, profit, growth and
risk.
Mechanisms such as Balanced Scorecards to their business performance,
emphasising the causal chains coursing through organizational capability,
operations and customer propositions, eventually landing into financial
performance as an outcome.
More recently, there has been an emphasis on key stakeholder metrics such as
ESG adding further dimensions to responsible business performance.

The paradigm of business performance has largely hinged on organizations
directly influencing their customer engagements with their products and services.
Indeed, the prevalent use of the term "customer" is ingrained as a
counterpart to the organizations’ products.
Dramatic advances in the digital economy, especially in the area of mobile 
and sensor technology over the last 15 years, have highlighted the 
perception of value through insights into consumption/use.
In other words, the presumed value in organizations’ products and services
is increasingly validated through actual insights into consumption/use
by consumers.

This shift in perspective of an organizations’ products and services as
patterns (based on insights) of consumer use is where movements such as
design thinking}, customer journey maps etc are increasingly considered
as important tools for developing and validating propositions.
The "aha" and "viola" moments from such exercises require further
translation into realizing the propositions,
which is where practices around agility, DevOps etc are increasingly mainstream.

All these themes and mechanisms of strategy execution through
communication, product/service propositions, development/deployment
and its performance management largely depend on a human capital 
based on participation, expertise and intuition.
Organizations wishing to amplify their human capital face a few key 
dichotomies to be addressed:

**Customer vs Consumer**

:   Mindset and capability shift from "Customer market share" to
    "share of (end) consumer value"

**Enterprise vs Ecosystem**

:   Mindset and capability shift from “Proprietary control of customer
    experiences” to “open collaboration on consumer experiences”

**Human Machine Continuum**

:   Mindset shift from human-scaled to machine-scaled (intelligent and
    autonomous) business capability

Each of the above dichotomies highlights the limitations enterprises face
today in extending business capability beyond their organizational
boundaries, be it in sourcing information beyond their own channels or
collaborating on shared experiences.

Addressing these challenges requires enterprises to adopt an exploratory
style in executing their strategy[^what-is-strategy] which specifically 
focuses on sensing and understanding the consumer ecosystem better before 
taking decisions and acting (to be aligned to hyper-personalization, 
both in retail and business consumer scenarios)

To put this “Explorative Execution” into perspective, a useful 
mental model is SUDA (Sense, Understand, Decide, Act, a slight variant
of John Boyd’s OODA loop), specifically focused on responding/acting 
in a dynamic evolving environment.
The choice of the mental model is to bring out its contrast with the
imperative style mental model of Plan, Do, Check, Act (PDCA),
usually used for acting in an environment of more certainty and 
predictability.

**SENSE**

:   Accessing actual contents of need and use by consumers easily overwhelms
    most organizations for a variety of reasons, chief amongst which is the 
    sheer volume of context-unique interactions which must be checked for 
     links to an organization’s business interests and intents.
    Most of this is practiced subjectively and accorded to human expertise
    and intuition.

**UNDERSTAND**

:   Unlike the carefully curated lens of its products and services,
    inputs of interest for an organization are generally ambiguous 
    requiring significant efforts to disambiguate and synthesize.
    (John Boyd’s Orientation isn’t just a state you’re in; it’s a process. 
    You’re always orienting.)

**DECIDE**

:   Disambiguated information still isn’t directly actionable as there is
    a significant element of hypothesis embedded within.
    This is especially challenging with high prevalence of conflicting 
    hypotheses in many cases.

**ACT**

:   Filtered sensing, hypothesis-based understanding and scenario-driven 
    decision-making finally create an actionable context, which the
    organizational operations can execute.

A deeper analysis of the SUDA-loop of “Explorative Execution” brings
into focus the following requirements of capability:

**Identity**

:   How can sensing be practiced in a subject domain of multiple identities?
    How can a shift from form-based to a function-based identity be enabled?

**Self-describing**

:   How can understanding be practiced in a subject domain with 
    multiple descriptions?
    How can a shift from structure-based description to a 
    behavior-based description be enabled?

**Open world ambiguity**

:   How can decision-making be practiced in scenarios which require constant
    revalidation and conflict resolution, as new facts become known?

_<ins>An EKG is a key organizational capability to enable Explorative Execution
using a SUDA mental model</ins>_, through the following core features:

**SENSE**

:   - Co-existence of multiple identifications based on context and
      interpretation instead of the prevalent content based identification
    - How do retail consumers and business consumers use products and services?

**UNDERSTAND**

:   - Emphasis on meaning through association rather than static descriptions
    - Enhanced collaboration with ecosystem partners through standards on
      context sharing rather than lengthy negotiations on content specifics
    - How do the products and services address needs of consumers?

**DECIDE**

:   - Significant scale in knowledge driven operations through autonomous reasoning
    - Leverage of existing (diverse and federated) content sources instead of
      separate curated content repositories
    - How can products and services add more value through effective use?
    - What changes can be made to make products and services more relevant
      for (retail and business) consumers?

## Business Identity

_Business Identity_ is a statement of a company's unique innovation, service, 
and/or product based value proposition.
A _business identity_, published to the world via business identifier unique 
Enterprise Knowledge Graphs, may transparently use a data infrastructure that
can support many distinct business activities.

An enterprise could have multiple Business Identities based on the value
propositions underlying its products and services---it is imperative that
each must be perceived (as having differentiators) and consumed (as unique
offerings) by its customers and stakeholders.

- The **Sense** imperative is addressed by using the Business Identity
  as an “attractor” amidst the voluminous stream of interactions.
  This is especially important in a privacy conscious environment where
  interest in and intent of using information is clearly understood and
  agreed upon upfront.
- The **Understand** imperative is addressed by using the Business Identity
  as a common link between the complementary mechanisms of (a) fulfilment 
  within an enterprise and (b) the collaboration contexts with the partners.
- The **Decide** imperative is addressed by using the Business Identity
  as an enterprise persona for scenario planning and evaluation --- rather
  than viewing an enterprise as a structural entity.

Business Identity enables an (EKG powered) enterprise to constantly
assess and align its value propositions to a) the needs and use-contexts
of consumers and b) the collaboration mechanisms with business partners
for effective fulfilment.

Examples of prominent _brand statements_:

**Apple Watch**

:   _It’s the ultimate device for a healthy life.
    Apple Watch can do what your other devices can't because it's on
    your wrist.
    When you wear it, you get a fitness partner that measures all the
    ways you move, meaningful health insights, and a connection to the
    people and things you care about most. 
    And it's always just a glance away._
    
**Netflix**

:   _Unlimited films, TV programmes and more. Watch anywhere. 
    Cancel at any time.
    Netflix is a subscription-based streaming service that allows our
    members to watch TV shows and movies without commercials on an
    internet-connected device._

A _Business Identity_ can link brand statements such as the above with
the wider contexts of an Enterprise’s corporate values, vision etc and
the specifics of the product/service features and
integration with other products/services of the enterprise/wider ecosystem.

### Aligning Business Identity with Activities in an Enterprise

Enterprises use a variety of mechanisms today to organize “inventories”
of their activities.
The artifacts take a variety of forms ranging from free-form documentation
of manuals, data and process models along different methodologies to 
data records and programming repositories.
Business Capability Models, 
Business Canvas, 
Business Reference Architectures etc 
have been some of the outputs used to serve as organization-wide 
references of activities.

The objectives guiding such management are mostly around efficiency of 
categorizing, storing and retrieval, focused around “what is done” and
“who does it”.
The key challenge in efficiency oriented approaches is that the
perception can be quite subjective based on the needs of the 
departments or teams --- which leads to a variety of approaches across
the length and breadth of any enterprise.
There are several implications of using such a variety of approaches ---
chief amongst which is the reconciliation effect expended every time a 
deviation has to be managed, exceptions have to be handled or a change 
introduced in any activity.
Targeting efficiency of reconciliations through techniques such as 
focus-groups, standardization of documentation etc.
is a typical response of most organizations.

Taking the intuitive notion of a Business Identity (as a conceptual 
anchor for an organization’s engagement with its stakeholders) 
forward, enterprises can benefit from using a simple, organization-wide 
concept anchor focused around “why is it done” for its activities.
This anchor need not be prescriptive to change the way an organization
manages its activities but descriptive to enhance the ability to more
effectively leverage information within the artifacts.

One candidate for such an intuitive anchor is the contract.
In fact, a contract may initially take the form of a memorandum of 
understanding (MOU), an agreement outlined in a formal document that
may later become a legal contract.
If we take the Business Identity as a basis for viewing an 
organization’s product and services, a contract can be seen as a 
specific engagement around which the activities of various 
departments and teams are organized.
More specifically, a contract can be seen as a collection of 
related commitments, potentially spread over time, which provide
the necessary context for any activity in an organization.
Interestingly, while it's well-understood that a contract is a 
definitive source of specifics around any agreement with 
stakeholders, it's currently referred to only in the extreme case 
of legal recourse in handling disagreements.
Another perception of contracts is that they do not cover all 
collaboration contexts which guide activities in an organization.

Contracts have several features which help align the 
Business Identity with the activities within an enterprise ---
and the wider ecosystem, for that matter.

- Together with the legal system and societal norms, 
  contracts provide a contextual basis for belief/trust 
  between an enterprise and its stakeholders in the ecosystem
- Contracts are specific to the parties involved and provide 
  an ideal contextual basis for (hyper)personalisation of 
  products and services --- through bounded simulation of 
  contract performance
- Measures of performance in organizational activities, 
  such as cost, operational efficiencies and innovation 
  effectiveness can be aligned to contractual performance contexts

We now look at two key elements of organizational activity
(enabled by EKG) aimed at orienting and realizing 
business strategy, through the lens of Business Identity and
Contracts:

* [Business Strategy Actuation](/pillar/business/capability-area/strategy-actuation/)
  is a business identity oriented process that senses, 
  understands and communicates business outcome-based 
  assessment data to focus energy and resources on
  strategic objectives.
  Actuation measurement values are used to assess 
  whether strategic objectives and associated
  business goals are being fulfilled.
* [Business Model Elaboration](/pillar/business/capability-area/business-model-elaboration/)
  is the process of providing further detail of
  business strategy.
  It may include decision rationale that explains how the
  business identity data infrastructure and algorithms 
  enable the how and why planned actions would
  create, deliver, and capture value.
