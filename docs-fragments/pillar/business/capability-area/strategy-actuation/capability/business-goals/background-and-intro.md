# Contribution to the EKG

Having clearly communicated, actionable and measurable Business Goals will help setting the direction
for the discovery and selection of use cases for the EKG.

At higher levels of maturity (level 3 and up), all Business Goals, at any level of granularity and scope,
would end up being modelled and become part of the EKG, directly or indirectly linked to every activity
in the organization, providing insights in cost, progress, effort and risks per stated goal.

# Contribution to the Enterprise

EKGs can help by enabling enterprises align expectations, evidences and
business metrics both in achieving and assessing progress on Strategic Goals.
