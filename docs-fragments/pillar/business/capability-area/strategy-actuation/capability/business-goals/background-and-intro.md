# Contribution to the EKG

Having clearly communicated, actionable and measurable Business Goals will help setting the direction
for the discovery and selection of use cases for the \gls{ekg}.

At higher levels of maturity (level 3 and up), all Business Goals, at any level of granularity and scope,
would end up being modelled and become part of the \gls{ekg}, directly or indirectly linked to every activity
in the organization, providing insights in cost, progress, effort and risks per stated goal.
