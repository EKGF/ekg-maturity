    Work in progress, this is just the results of an initial
    brainstorm session, needs to be worked out

1. How many of your business goals can be achieved with existing
   tactics? Scale 0-100%
2. Are you a  **"composable business"**? In other words can you 
   easily compose a new part of your business from existing 
   components? Scale 1-5
    - Components can be EKG components (including reusable 
      use cases and all their ontologies/models, datasets 
      and workflows/processes)
    - Components can also be whole organizational units, 
      production lines, machines, processes, people, 
      supply chains etc
3. Are you using **"positive learning"** to improve
   business performance? Scale 1-5
    - Do you track “lessons learned”?
    - Do you have well-defined “feedback loops” in place?
       - Closed and open feedback loops
       - Does it have AI/Human in the loop?
    - Are you comparing KPI measurements over time (and act upon it)?
    - Are you comparing KGI measurements over time (and act upon it)?
4. Do you have a well-defined **"knowledge transfer"** mechanism in place?
5. Do you measure your efficacy structurally on a scheduled basis 
   throughout your organization?
    - How is this measured?
6. Are you conducting well-founded SWOT analysis for every
   line of business?
7. Are you conducting KPI/KGI measurements?
