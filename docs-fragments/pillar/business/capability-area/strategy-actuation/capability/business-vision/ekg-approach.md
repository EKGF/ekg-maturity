Business Vision forms the key anchor to the Enterpriseâ€™s [Business Identity](../../../../../../../docs/pillar/business/background-and-intro/#business-identity) and through it, 
links to the various policies, products, contracts and eventually transactional activities. 
This linkage-based practice is especially useful as Enterprises focus on demonstrating 
transparency and integrity in their management conduct and stakeholder reporting.
