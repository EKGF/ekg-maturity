### Contribution to the EKG

Having clearly communicated a  vision and its components will help setting
the direction for the discovery and selection of
use cases for the EKG.

At higher levels of maturity (level 3 and up) the Business Vision
itself would be a key use case for the EKG, allowing any other part
of the EKG to be directly or indirectly relatable to the vision, guiding principles,
goals, providing insights into which components of the organization
(people, systems, products etc.) are supporting the vision and how.

### Contribution to the Enterprise

An enterpriseâ€™s Vision and Mission have been mechanisms for easy
retention and recall within its rank and file---for guidance and
motivation in activities---as well as its public image.
As communications and activities of enterprises become more digital,
leveraging a mix of human and machine scale capabilities, EKGs can
help by enabling enterprises to align the Vision and Mission
in the context of activities, through the [Business Identity](../../../../business/background-and-intro/#business-identity).
Importantly, the Business Identity anchored EKG can provide a
contextual lens for articulation, validation and justification
of Business Vision at any level of activity of an
Enterprise---within as well as across its boundaries.
