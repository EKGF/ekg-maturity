# Background & Intro

In contrast to strategy, business vision denotes the timeless character of companies
and other organizations as it consists of matters that transcend time.
These matters are *(1) a core ideology*, and *(2) an envisioned future*.

**Core ideology is what we stand for and why we exist**

: Core ideology defines a consistent identity of an organization that transcends 
  market cycles, technological breakthroughs, economic conjunctures and individual 
  leaders. 
  A well-sound core ideology provides a narrative that will hold people together 
  as the company grows to new markets, business lines and changes over time.

Any core ideology should consist of two components:

1. **The core values** of  an organization are the timeless guiding principles or
   tenets of an organization that do not require further *justification*. 
   Any organization should decide for itself which core values to hold regardless 
   of its current environment.
2. **The core purpose** of an organization is its deepest reason for existing.
   Core purpose should not be confused with strategy or goals since, unlikely to 
   strategy or goals, a core purpose cannot be achieved. 
   It should be an ideal to aspire towards for the whole organization and that can
   never be achieved. 
   Otherwise, it would lose its timeless character.
   
**Envisioned future is what the organization aspires to become, to create and to leave behind**

: An envisioned future is inspired and determined by the core values and core purpose of the organization.
   
Similarly to core ideology, an envisioned future consists of two parts:
   
1. **Big, Hairy, Audacious Goals (BHAGs)** are inspiring stories that serve as a 
   focal point for effort, are a catalyst for team spirit and mark a clear finish line. 
   BHAGs should be attainable in a 10-to-30 years time window and should be 
   highly focussed, tangible and highly focussed.
2. **A vivid description** is what the future will be like if the organization 
   achieves all of its *BHAGs*.
   
### Round Up: Sony in the 50s

In order to illustrate these concepts, Sony will be used as an example of a 
very ambitious company that had a clearly defined vision in the 1950s and it 
has been fulfilling it quite successfully ever since.
Back then, Japanese products were not known for their quality and were considered 
inferior to US or European ones.
In order to change that, Sony developed an ambitious vision that would consist of 
different parts aligned to the concepts mentioned before.

#### Core ideology

##### Core Values

1. Elevation of the Japanese culture and national status.
2. Being a pioneer—not following others; doing the impossible.
3. Encouraging individual ability and creativity.
   
##### Core Purpose

: *To experience the sheer joy of innovation and the application of technology for the benefit and pleasure of the general public.*
   
#### Envisioned future
   
##### BHAGs

: _"Become the company most known for changing the worldwide poor-quality image of Japanese products."_
   
##### Vivid Description
   
_"We will create products that become pervasive around the world.... We will be the first Japanese company to go into the U.S. market and distribute directly.... We will succeed with innovations that U.S. companies have failed at—such as the transistor radio.... Fifty years from now, our brand name will be as well known as any in the world...and will signify innovation and quality that rival the most innovative companies anywhere.... “Made in Japan” will mean something fine, not something shoddy."_
    
# Contribution to the EKG

Having clearly communicated a  vision and its components will help setting
the direction for the discovery and selection of
use cases for the EKG.

At higher levels of maturity (level 3 and up) the Business Vision
itself would be a key use case for the EKG, allowing any other part
of the EKG to be directly or indirectly relatable to the vision, guiding principles,
goals, providing insights into which components of the organization
(people, systems, products etc.) are supporting the vision and how.

# Contribution to the Enterprise

An enterprise’s Vision and Mission have been mechanisms for easy
retention and recall within its rank and file---for guidance and
motivation in activities---as well as its public image.
As communications and activities of enterprises become more digital,
leveraging a mix of human and machine scale capabilities, EKGs can
help by enabling enterprises to align the Vision and Mission
in the context of activities, through the Business Identity.
Importantly, the Business Identity anchored EKG can provide a
contextual lens for articulation, validation and justification
of Business Vision at any level of activity of an
Enterprise---within as well as across its boundaries.
