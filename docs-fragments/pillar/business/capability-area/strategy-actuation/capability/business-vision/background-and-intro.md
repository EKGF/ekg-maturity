# Contribution to the EKG

Having a clearly communicated Business Vision will help setting the direction for the discovery and selection of
use cases for the \gls{ekg}.

At higher levels of maturity (level 3 and up) the Business Vision itself would be a key use case for the \gls{ekg},
allowing any other part of the \gls{ekg} to be directly or indirectly relatable to the vision, goals, providing
insights into which components of the organization (people, systems, products etc.) are supporting the vision and how.
