# Background & Intro

Change is happening everywhere in organizations.
The digitalization of everything (IoT, edge computing, digital transform)
has created a fluid context for change, and the need to decentralize 
decision-making to keep pace with exponential change and complexity
requires non-linear thinking, planning, and execution.

The current approaches for change management are usually built 
on linear models which do not scale nor can they collate
the facets of data --- let alone semantic perspectives ---, 
that are overwhelming decision makers.

    Ask not what Change Management can do for EKG,
    rather ask what EKG can do for Change Management

EKGs are the only way to build a scalable framework of understanding 
about change and capture relevant patterns to guide option analysis 
and impact analysis.
The days of getting in a room and relying on meetings is quickly 
coming to an end.
AI, Bayesian Analysis, Game Theory, MCDA, and Heuristics can help, 
but <ins>only</ins> if we can guide them properly using EKGs.

# Contribution to the EKG

The EKG should be updated to reflect changes made to the enterprise
as a result of change projects.
EKG governance is a set of change processes that should follow a 
disciplined change approach to protect the integrity and value 
of the knowledge graph.
