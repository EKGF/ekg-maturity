# Background & Intro

Change is happening everywhere in organizations.
The digitalization of everything (IoT, edge computing, digital transform)
has created a fluid context for change, and the need to decentralize 
decision-making to keep pace with exponential change and complexity
requires non-linear thinking, planning, and execution.

The current approaches for change management are usually built 
on linear models which do not scale nor can they collate
the facets of data --- let alone semantic perspectives ---, 
that are overwhelming decision makers.

    Ask not what Change Management can do for EKG,
    rather ask what EKG can do for Change Management

EKGs are the only way to build a scalable framework of understanding 
about change and capture relevant patterns to guide option analysis 
and impact analysis.
The days of getting in a room and relying on meetings is quickly 
coming to an end.
AI, Bayesian Analysis, Game Theory, MCDA, and Heuristics can help, 
but <ins>only</ins> if we can guide them properly using EKGs.

# Contribution to the EKG

The EKG should be updated to reflect changes made to the enterprise
as a result of change projects.
EKG governance is a set of change processes that should follow a 
disciplined change approach to protect the integrity and value 
of the knowledge graph.

# Contribution to the Enterprise

The EKG can hold the model of the enterprise to identify potential
areas for change to include:
discover duplication across business silos, impact analysis of areas
targeted to change, impact of regulatory change, impact of entering
new markets, impact of scaling the business, impact from major 
incidents and issues, and can serve as a baseline for evaluating 
and executing merger/acquisition of new enterprises.

The EKG can hold the information on current state of the enterprise
for reuse of information to start the project, ideal state of the 
enterprise, intended new state of the enterprise after the change
is deployed, and updated for actual resulting business knowledge 
from deploying the change.
