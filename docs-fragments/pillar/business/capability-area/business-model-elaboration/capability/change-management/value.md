### Contribution to the EKG

The EKG should be updated to reflect changes made to the enterprise
as a result of change projects.
EKG governance is a set of change processes that should follow a
disciplined change approach to protect the integrity and value
of the knowledge graph.

### Contribution to the Enterprise

The EKG can hold the model of the enterprise to identify potential
areas for change to include:
discover duplication across business silos, impact analysis of areas
targeted to change, impact of regulatory change, impact of entering
new markets, impact of scaling the business, impact from major
incidents and issues, and can serve as a baseline for evaluating
and executing merger/acquisition of new enterprises.

The EKG can hold the information on current state of the enterprise
for reuse of information to start the project, ideal state of the
enterprise, intended new state of the enterprise after the change
is deployed, and updated for actual resulting business knowledge
from deploying the change.
