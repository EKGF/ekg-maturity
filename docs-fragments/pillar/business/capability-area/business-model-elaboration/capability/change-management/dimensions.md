!!! warn

    Work in progress, this is just the results of an initial
    brainstorm session, needs to be worked out

1. Do you have a Change Management plan and is it driving everything?
2. Is your plan related to and driven by your value streams and how 
   it will lead from current to future state?
3. Do you know which EKG Use Cases you require to implement your
   Change Management plans?
4. Is “Positive Learning” in place? Is there a feedback loop of 
   metrics for past performance continuously improving your 
   change management plans? Scale 1-5
5. Can be measured more systematically by understanding how many 
   EKG use cases are reused and involved in each new step along the way
