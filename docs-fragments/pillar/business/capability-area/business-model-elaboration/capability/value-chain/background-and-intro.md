# Background & Intro

!!! note inline end "[McKinsey Digital](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/how-do-companies-create-value-from-digital-ecosystems)"

    Most global companies are now actively considering the ecosystem 
    business model given its value-generation potential:
    growing the core business, expanding the network and portfolio, 
    and generating revenues from new products and services.

Value chains have been a prominent way of organizing and linking 
activities in an Enterprise to create value for its customers, 
thorough provision of products and services.
Digitalization and the increasing focus on consumer-centricity 
has pushed the imperatives of Value Chains to include more 
holistic collaborations in the business ecosystem---reshaping
provision of services and access to untapped pools of value.

# Contribution to the EKG

Having the Value Chain(s) of an organization defined can help with the selection, 
definition and prioritization of the right use cases for the EKG.

# Contribution to the Enterprise

In the EKG context, a "digital twin" of a company's value chain can
be modelled where all the various components of the value chain are
represented e.q. all details around logistics, supply chains, 
operations, services, marketing, sales and all support activities.
At higher levels of maturity, all real-world details of these 
components are available as well and represent the reality accurately
and in real-time.
