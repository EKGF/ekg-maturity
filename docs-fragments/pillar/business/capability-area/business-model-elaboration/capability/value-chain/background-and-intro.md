# Background & Intro

!!! note inline end "[McKinsey Digital](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/how-do-companies-create-value-from-digital-ecosystems)"

    Most global companies are now actively considering the ecosystem 
    business model given its value-generation potential:
    growing the core business, expanding the network and portfolio, 
    and generating revenues from new products and services.

Value chains have been a prominent way of organizing and linking activities in an Enterprise to create value
for its customers, thorough provision of products and services.
Digitalization and the increasing focus on consumer-centricity has pushed the 
imperatives of Value Chains to include more holistic collaborations in the
business ecosystem --- reshaping provision of services and access to untapped pools of value.

definition and prioritization of the right use cases for the EKG.
