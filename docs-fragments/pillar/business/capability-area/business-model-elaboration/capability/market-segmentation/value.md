### Contribution to the EKG

The EKG can bring all possible internal and external detail information
about customers, products, services, competition, sales volumes,
customer requirements and many other details together forming a
holistic and realistic, almost real-time view of the position of
the company in their markets.

### Contribution to the Enterprise

Having the proper Market Segments defined will help with the selection,
definition and prioritization of the right use cases for the EKG.
