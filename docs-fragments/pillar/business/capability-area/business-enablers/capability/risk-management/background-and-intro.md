# Background & Intro

Risk Management has traditionally been an integral, and sometimes implicit, part of an Enterprise’s
Business Governance practices.
Though there are guidelines for business governance in every country, not all are formulated as regulations;
some are only generally accepted norms of conduct[^integration_of_risk_management].
Some examples of well-known governance and risk frameworks are

- The BASEL Accord framework (for financial services organizations) used by regulators globally for their
  specific jurisdiction directives covering management practices around operational, credit and market risks
- COSO, a private sector initiative (sector agnostic) dedicated to helping organizations improve
  performance by developing thought leadership that enhances internal control, risk management,
  governance and fraud deterrence

Enterprises use a variety of internal control systems, both formally and informally,
to monitor their governance mechanisms.
The COSO-model[^erm_integrating_with_strategy_and_performance], for example, defines internal control as
_...designed to provide reasonable assurance of the achievement of objectives in the following categories:_

- _Operational Effectiveness and Efficiency_
- _Financial Reporting Reliability_
- _Applicable Laws and Regulations Compliance_

A recent study[^erm_the_state_of_risk_oversight] on the practices around ERM has highlighted the following:

- Effective risk management is a priority among boards of directors;
  organizations are facing pressures from a number of stakeholders to provide more risk information and
  business leaders want to be better prepared when unexpected risk events emerge to avoid being surprised
- Most organizations continue to struggle to integrate their risk management and strategic planning efforts;
  risk tolerances are not formally articulated as part of their strategic management activities
- There are a number of impediments to advancing an organization’s risk management processes,
  with the belief that "risks are managed in other ways besides ERM" dominating the list
- There is a heavy emphasis on risks related to technology, legal/compliance and financial issues,
  with ERM processes less focused on emerging strategic/market/industry risks or risk related to reputation
- There are opportunities to reposition an entity's risk management process to ensure risk insights
  generated are focused on the most important strategic issues

# Contribution to the Enterprise

Considering the above on the state, imperatives and 
opportunities in an enterprise’s risk management practices,
we highlight below a few key focus areas where EKG can 
help/enable enterprises:

## _Holistic, inter-related, strategy aligned and performance monitoring integrated risk management_

The topical approaches to risk management is a direct result 
of the silos of operations in various enterprise units.
As outlined in the earlier sections, through Business Identities,
EKGs can enable enterprises to align business strategy with the
operating model and the performance management, thus creating
bridges between and aligning the silos of operations to 
enterprise strategy.
The inter-relationship, in the context of strategic objectives,
can enable risk management to evaluate and monitor risk in a 
holistic manner.
Qualitative and subjective metrics to more quantitative 
and objective metrics based risk management practices:
Narrowly focused risk factors, owing to siloed specialisations 
have led to use of predominantly qualitative metrics
in risk monitoring.
EKGs can help align risk factors with metrics in 
performance management, thus helping in use of more 
effective quantitative objective metrics in risk monitoring.

## _Evaluation and prioritization of emerging risks through explorative analysis:_

Specialised areas of risk dominate focus of risk management, 
while strategic issues require a coordinated action across 
multiple operational areas.
In helping to align risk monitoring more closely to the strategic issues,
EKGs can enable enterprises to evaluate and prioritize key 
emerging risks affecting the strategy through enterprise wide, 
exploratory scenario-based analysis.
