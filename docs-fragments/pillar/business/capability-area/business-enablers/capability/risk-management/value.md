### Contribution to the Enterprise

Considering the above on the state, imperatives and
opportunities in an enterpriseâ€™s risk management practices,
we highlight below a few key focus areas where EKG can
help/enable enterprises:

## _Holistic, inter-related, strategy aligned and performance monitoring integrated risk management_

The topical approaches to risk management is a direct result
of the silos of operations in various enterprise units.
As outlined in the earlier sections, through Business Identities,
EKGs can enable enterprises to align business strategy with the
operating model and the performance management, thus creating
bridges between and aligning the silos of operations to
enterprise strategy.
The interrelationship, in the context of strategic objectives,
can enable risk management to evaluate and monitor risk in a
holistic manner.
Qualitative and subjective metrics to more quantitative
and objective metrics based risk management practices:
Narrowly focused risk factors, owing to siloed specialisations
have led to use of predominantly qualitative metrics
in risk monitoring.
EKGs can help align risk factors with metrics in
performance management, thus helping in use of more
effective quantitative objective metrics in risk monitoring.

## _Evaluation and prioritization of emerging risks through explorative analysis:_

Specialised areas of risk dominate focus of risk management,
while strategic issues require a coordinated action across
multiple operational areas.
In helping to align risk monitoring more closely to the strategic issues,
EKGs can enable enterprises to evaluate and prioritize key
emerging risks affecting the strategy through enterprise wide,
exploratory scenario-based analysis.
