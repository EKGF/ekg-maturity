!!! warn

    Work in progress, this is just the results of an initial
    brainstorm session, needs to be worked out

1. Are all your supply chains, internal and external, identified and described?
    - Are standards used for identifiers (and all other data) across the 
      ecosystem of the supply chain?
2. **Data Integration**: How many of them are tied to business capabilities?
    - Are all concepts around products, services, contracts, deliveries,
      distribution defined with machine-readable shared, standard semantics? 
3. **Risk**: Did you define your risk-exposure associated with your
   supply chain?
    - Do you have a risk assessment for every vendor?
    - Do you have a risk assessment for any third party in your supply chain? 
    - As an example risk: is your cybersecurity assessment done for all 
      parties in your supply chain?
    - Same for data protection/privacy
5. Does every line of business manager understand who their vendors are?
6. How well do you understand (and how well is that defined), the products 
   and services in your supply chain?
7. How well is your supply chain optimized in relation to other supply chains
   of other lines of business?
8. Are all products and services in your supply chain covered through their 
   whole life-cycle? Birth-to-death? / Cradle-to-Cradle?
    - _(Cradle to cradle is a sustainable business strategy that mimics the 
      regenerative cycle of nature in which waste is reused. 
      In nature, when a tree or animal dies or creates waste, that waste
      breaks down and becomes nutrients for another process.)_
9. Is any of the above automated and/or modeled? 
10. Is all data related to your value chain shared across all other relevant
    lines of business? 
     - Do you share vendors, distributors etc 
     - Risk analysis on your vendors (financially stable, quality, backup 
       vendor etc, how dependent is your LOB on any given vendor,
       vendor lock-in)
11. Are all contracts digitized? 
    - Are they registered in a distributed immutable ledger thatâ€™s not 
      controlled by a single party? 
    - Distributed 
    - Transparent 
12. How standard is your supply chain, is it using shared practices and 
    concepts across the industry?
