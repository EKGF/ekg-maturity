# Background & Intro

In recent years, the word capability has steadily been drawing attention in the business world
as a way to narrow the gap between business and IT.
A capability is described by Ulrich and Rosen, (p.1, 2011) as:

> A business capability, or simply a “capability,” defines what a business does.
> It does not communicate or expose where, why, or how something is done---only what is done.
> Specifically, the business capability is “a particular ability or capacity that a business may possess or
> exchange to achieve a specific purpose or outcome.

Understanding _what_ a business does is at least as important as understanding _how_ it does it.
Focusing on the _what_ rather than on the _how_ often provides the right level of abstraction
of complex ecosystems in a way that can be easily digested by business executives and planning teams.
Dissecting a business as a set of basic capabilities allows one to view complex organizations and
business environments in a wide range of different ways.
Additionally, one could zoom in on lower levels of abstraction to reach higher levels of detail
depending on the needs of the target audience.

Consider the example of the high-level capability called _customer 360°_.
This capability refers to having a complete picture of the customer and this is a capability many organizations may
benefit from.
A customer may be called a taxpayer in the context of a government institution, a patient in the context of a hospital
and a student in the context of a university.
Being able to manage different aspects of a customer might be imperative for many businesses depending on
their business strategy.
For instance, _customer 360°_ as a high-level capability could entail the _customer trend analysis_ and
_customer management information_ capabilities as lower-level capabilities.

In other words, this means that capabilities are _concerns_ that could be refined into lower-level capabilities
that in turn could be further refined.
The advantage of functional decomposition in this hierarchical and modular way is that it increases the reusability
of capabilities across business lines, enterprises or even industries.
Additionally, decomposing capabilities in different levels of abstraction offers a better sense of how
capabilities fit in on the overall view of the enterprise.

Capabilities should follow certain principles as follows:

1. **Capabilities define what a business does and not how a business does it.**
   This implies that a capability does not refer to a process or value stream.
2. **Capabilities are nouns, not verbs.**
   To make the distinction between a capability and a process, capabilities should be named with nouns such as
   customer management instead of a verb managing customers.
3. **Capabilities should be defined in business term and not in technical terms.**
   Executives and other business professionals should be able to clearly understand what a capability means
   ---and take ownership of it---without being bothered with the technical details of the systems
   that implement it.
4. **Capabilities should be stable (i.e. least volatile) as possible.**
   There is a fundamental set of high-level capabilities that are necessary to run a business regardless
   of the sector of industry it is located in. Additionally, high-level capabilities may rarely change
   within an organization unless there are significant changes to its business strategy or organization.
5. **Capabilities are not redundant.**
   Capabilities appear once and only once on a capability maps even though they are shared by more than division,
   business line or business unit of an enterprise.
6. **There should only be one business capability map per business.**
   In order to bring transparency across the organization, there should be a single unified and harmonized
   business capability map per business.
   Therefore, business capabilities spread throughout different business units, divisions, department,
   lines of business, etc should be only appear once in the business capability map.
7. **Capabilities map to---but are not the same as---business processes, business units,
   Lines of Business (LOBs) and value streams.**
   There is rarely a one-to-one mapping between a business process, a business unit, an LOB or
   a value stream, and a capability.
   Therefore, mistaking a capability with one these other concepts may result in an overly complex overview of
   things that are constantly repeated across the enterprise.
   Additionally, we’re trying to understand the what rather than the how and this would not be possible if
   capabilities are mistaken with  process-related concepts.
8. **Automated capabilities are still business capabilities and not IT capabilities.**
   Capabilities are owned by the business as they are made by and for the business.
   Therefore, a capability that has been automated with an IT system is not an IT capability.
   Instead, it is nothing else than an _automated business capability_.
9. **Capabilities are the most valuable when incorporated in the overall pictures of a business’ ecosystem.**
   While being useful in a stand-alone basis for discussion and planning, capabilities fulfil their biggest
   potential by being combined into a larger business capability map that represents the business ecosystem
   of an enterprise.

# Contribution to the EKG

The _Business Capability Map_ enables an enterprise to structure their 
Enterprise Knowledge Graph.
Each capability is a candidate to become a _use case_ for the EKG.

A well-designed mature EKG is a facade in front of all technical and 
organizational silos which means that---without any further structure---users 
do not experience the negative effects of these silos anymore.
In many ways that may be a good thing but having silos---or different
perspectives---can also be necessary.
The EKG allows an organization to rethink their silos without being
held back by their current data or technology
landscape (or "technical debt").

The _Business Capability Map_ is the ideal initial structure for the 
new EKG "silos".
Business Capability Maps are usually rather coarse-grained and 
visualized in a three-level hierarchy whereas the
structure of the EKG goes much further than that.
Translating each capability to a 
_[use case](https://use-case-tree-method.ekgf.org/concept/usecase/)_ 
is a good start but each of these use cases can be further broken down
into smaller use cases where each use case becomes a 
highly reusable component of the EKG.
This leads to a hierarchical structure---a taxonomy so you will---of
all use cases, also called _"the Use Case Tree"_ (UCT).
This use case tree, at the higher levels, corresponds with the 
Business Capability Map and allows a business and its executives 
to "own" and control all the various parts of their EKG.

# Contribution to the Enterprise

As a business/IT transformation enabler, capabilities may 
provide certain benefits to enterprises:

* **Capabilities provide business with a common language.**<br/>
  Capabilities offer business professionals and C-level executives
  a common understanding of which areas of an enterprise they need 
  to address. The larger the enterprise, the more useful this idea
  is since business issues and strategy may revolve around many 
  business units, lines of business, business processes, or even 
  enterprise boundaries.
* **Capabilities may enable more precise investments.**<br/>
  Measuring the ROI of investment projects can be very 
  difficult as the results might be spread across a myriad of 
  different LOBs or business units.
  Instead of reconciling results from all these different places,
  one could merely look at the resources being allocated at a 
  certain capability and this may allow business executives to 
  have better estimates of the impact of their investments on the
  enterprise as a _whole_.
* **Capabilities serve as a baseline for strategic planning, change management and impact analysis.**<br/>
  By shifting the focus from business units, lines of business, 
  IT systems and business processes to business capabilities, 
  one is able to increase the traceability of strategic decisions
  into the daily operations and the business performance of the 
  enterprise as a _whole_.
  So, capabilities serve as a starting point for tracking the 
  impact horizontal and vertical impacts of strategic and 
  tactical decisions from the executive team.
* **Capabilities lead to better business service specification and design.**<br/>
  Capabilities provide business-focused abstraction of the 
  functionalities and information that information systems 
  must provide.
  For instance, such capabilities may help in the selection 
  or construction of services in a SOA as they directly 
  embody business requirements.

In a few words, capabilities provide business executives the 
possibility to cut through the complexity inherent to most 
enterprises in order to make sounder decisions for 
strategic planning, impact analysis and investment planning.
Using capabilities enables business to make decisions based 
on _what_ needs to be resolved without initially dealing with
the _how_.
At the same time, it provides a way to tie the _how_ to the
results of the _what_for further validation that business 
efforts are delivery the expected results and for better alignment.
On the other hand, the alternative to this approach involves 
repeating the traditional silo-focused approach of looking at
hundreds or even thousands of IT systems, before being able to 
look at actual business actions and business results.
