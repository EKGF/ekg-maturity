A business scalability assessment is a process of evaluating an organization's ability to grow and adapt to changing market conditions, customer preferences, and competitive 
pressures. Without an enterprise knowledge graph, the scalability assessment would typically involve a lot of manual effort, data gathering, and analysis, and it would be 
difficult to maintain and update the assessment as the organization evolves.

Without an enterprise knowledge graph, the scalability assessment would typically involve the following steps:

1. _Identify the objectives and criteria of the assessment_: The first step would be to identify the goals and objectives of the scalability assessment, as well as the criteria
   and metrics that will be used to evaluate the organization's scalability. This would typically involve interviews and discussions with key stakeholders, as well as a review
   of relevant documents and data sources.


2. _Collect and organize data_: The next step would be to collect and organize the data and information needed to conduct the scalability assessment. This would typically 
   involve manually gathering data from various sources, such as internal databases, external sources, and interviews with subject matter experts.


3. _Analyze and classify the data_: The next step would be to analyze and classify the data, to identify the key drivers and barriers to scalability for the organization.
   This would typically involve manual analysis and classification, using techniques such as benchmarking, modeling, and simulation.


4. _Conduct the scalability assessment_: The next step would be to conduct the actual scalability assessment, using the criteria and metrics identified in the previous step. 
   This would typically involve manually evaluating the data and information collected and analyzed in previous steps, and comparing it to industry benchmarks and best 
   practices.


5. _Review and refine the assessment_: The final step would be to review and refine the scalability assessment, based on feedback from stakeholders and further analysis. 
    This would typically involve iterative cycles of review, refinement, and validation, to ensure that the assessment accurately reflects the organization's scalability
    and potential for growth.


Without an enterprise knowledge graph, the scalability assessment would be a time-consuming and labor-intensive process, with limited flexibility and scalability. 
It would be difficult to maintain and update the assessment as the organization evolves, and it would be challenging to use the assessment to drive decision-making and 
strategic planning.
