The maturity level of a business in implementing a business scalability assessment with an enterprise knowledge graph refers to the extent to which the business has integrated the use of an enterprise knowledge graph into its scalability assessment process and the level of sophistication and effectiveness of this integration. Here are five potential maturity levels:


1. _EKG initiation_: At this stage, the organization is just starting to explore the use of an enterprise knowledge graph and may be in the early stages of planning or piloting its implementation.


2. _Extensible Platform_: At this stage, the organization has implemented an enterprise knowledge graph and is starting to build out its capabilities and integrations with other systems and processes.


3. _Enterprise Ready_: At this stage, the organization has fully implemented an enterprise knowledge graph and has established processes and infrastructure to support its use across the organization.


4. _Strategic Asset_: At this stage, the organization is using the enterprise knowledge graph as a key strategic asset, leveraging its capabilities to drive innovation and inform decision-making.


5. _Operational Ecosystem_: At this stage, the enterprise knowledge graph is fully integrated into the organization's operations and is a key part of the organization's overall ecosystem.
