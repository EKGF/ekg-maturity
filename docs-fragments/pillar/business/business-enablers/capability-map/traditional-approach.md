Without an Enterprise Knowledge Graph (EKG), the development of a capability map would likely involve manually gathering data on the capabilities that are important to your organization. This could involve reviewing internal documents, conducting market research, and seeking input from experts within the organization.

Once the data has been collected, you would need to manually organize and structure it in a way that allows you to create a visual representation of your organization's capabilities. This could be in the form of a diagram, chart, or other visual tool.

Without the EKG, you would also need to find a way to store and manage the data that you have collected. This could involve creating and maintaining manual records, or using a separate database or spreadsheet tool.

Finally, you would need to find a way to link the capabilities on the map to related information and resources, such as training materials, best practices, and case studies. This could involve manually searching for and compiling this information, or relying on other tools or systems to help you access and organize it.

Overall, the development of a capability map without an EKG would likely be more time-consuming and labor-intensive, as it would involve manually gathering and organizing data, and finding ways to access and link related information and resources. Moreover, certain capabilities may not be able to be implemented with other technologies but EKG.

    Work in progress, describe how this capability is possibly being delivered today in a non-EKG context and optionally what the issues are that EKG could or should improve
