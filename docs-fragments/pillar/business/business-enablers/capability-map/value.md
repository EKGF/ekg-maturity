### Contribution to the EKG

The _Business Capability Map_ enables an enterprise to structure their
Enterprise Knowledge Graph.
Each capability is a candidate to become a _use case_ for the EKG.

A well-designed mature EKG is a facade in front of all technical and
organizational silos which means that---without any further structure---users
do not experience the negative effects of these silos anymore.
In many ways that may be a good thing but having silos---or different
perspectives---can also be necessary.
The EKG allows an organization to rethink their silos without being
held back by their current data or technology
landscape (or "technical debt").

The _Business Capability Map_ is the ideal initial structure for the
new EKG "silos".
Business Capability Maps are usually rather coarse-grained and
visualized in a three-level hierarchy whereas the
structure of the EKG goes much further than that.
Translating each capability to a
_[use case](https://method.ekgf.org/concept/usecase/)_
is a good start but each of these use cases can be further broken down
into smaller use cases where each use case becomes a
highly reusable component of the EKG.
This leads to a hierarchical structure---a taxonomy so you will---of
all use cases, also called _"the Use Case Tree"_ (UCT).
This use case tree, at the higher levels, corresponds with the
Business Capability Map and allows a business and its executives
to "own" and control all the various parts of their EKG.

### Contribution to the Enterprise

As a business/IT transformation enabler, capabilities may
provide certain benefits to enterprises:

* **Capabilities provide business with a common language.**<br/>
  Capabilities offer business professionals and C-level executives
  a common understanding of which areas of an enterprise they need
  to address. The larger the enterprise, the more useful this idea
  is since business issues and strategy may revolve around many
  business units, lines of business, business processes, or even
  enterprise boundaries.
* **Capabilities may enable more precise investments.**<br/>
  Measuring the ROI of investment projects can be very
  difficult as the results might be spread across a myriad of
  different LOBs or business units.
  Instead of reconciling results from all these different places,
  one could merely look at the resources being allocated at a
  certain capability and this may allow business executives to
  have better estimates of the impact of their investments on the
  enterprise as a _whole_.
* **Capabilities serve as a baseline for strategic planning, change management and impact analysis.**<br/>
  By shifting the focus from business units, lines of business,
  IT systems and business processes to business capabilities,
  one is able to increase the traceability of strategic decisions
  into the daily operations and the business performance of the
  enterprise as a _whole_.
  So, capabilities serve as a starting point for tracking the
  impact horizontal and vertical impacts of strategic and
  tactical decisions from the executive team.
* **Capabilities lead to better business service specification and design.**<br/>
  Capabilities provide business-focused abstraction of the
  functionalities and information that information systems
  must provide.
  For instance, such capabilities may help in the selection
  or construction of services in a SOA as they directly
  embody business requirements.

In a few words, capabilities provide business executives the
possibility to cut through the complexity inherent to most
enterprises in order to make sounder decisions for
strategic planning, impact analysis and investment planning.
Using capabilities enables business to make decisions based
on _what_ needs to be resolved without initially dealing with
the _how_.
At the same time, it provides a way to tie the _how_ to the
results of the _what_for further validation that business
efforts are delivery the expected results and for better alignment.
On the other hand, the alternative to this approach involves
repeating the traditional silo-focused approach of looking at
hundreds or even thousands of IT systems, before being able to
look at actual business actions and business results.
