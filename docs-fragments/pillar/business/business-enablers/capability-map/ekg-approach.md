A capability map is a visual representation of the capabilities of an organization or
business unit. 
It is typically used to identify areas of strength and areas that need improvement, 
and can be used to guide strategic planning and decision-making.

To develop a capability map with an Enterprise Knowledge Graph (EKG), 
you would first need to identify the capabilities that are important to
your organization. 

Next, you would need to gather data on these capabilities. 
This could include data on the current state of each capability, 
as well as information on trends and changes over time. 
This data could come from a variety of sources, including internal documents,
market research, and external experts.

Once you have collected this data, you can use it to create a visual representation
of your organization's capabilities. 
This could be in the form of a diagram, chart, or other visual tool. 
The EKG can then be used to store and manage this data, allowing you to 
easily access and update the capability map as needed.

The EKG can also be used to link the capabilities on the map to related information
and resources, such as training materials, best practices, and case studies. 
This can help to provide context and depth to the map, and can help to identify opportunities for growth and improvement.

Finally, the EKG could also be used to implement such capabilities and even to 
implement strategic capabilities such as Customer 360Â°.

    using an EKG approach, making the link to the "how" i.e.
