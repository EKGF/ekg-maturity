    Work in progress, this is just the results of an initial
    brainstorm session, needs to be worked out

1. Capability Map Coverage: does your capability map cover your
   whole business? Scale of 0-100%
2. Is your capability map represented in the EKG itself and if so, 
   what’s the coverage? Scale 0-100%
3. Is your Capability Map an executable model (and is it 
   actually executed)? Scale 1 to 5.
  - Note: this is “just” about the capability map model itself, not about executing all related models as well.
4. Percentage of business capabilities that can be fully automated?
   - TODO: work on this one
5. Did you identify, per business capability, which EKG use cases
   will deliver on that capability? Scale 0-100%
6. Did you identify the why of each business capability? Scale 1 to 5.
   - Notes: the who, what, when and how is more important for
     the other pillars
7. Do you understand the value of each capability
8. How does each capability fit in the business mission/vision/strategy
9. Did you identify the what of each business capability? Scale 1 to 5.
   - Notes: the who, what, when and how is more important for
     the other pillars
