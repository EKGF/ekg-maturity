Here is how the maturity levels of developing a capability map with an Enterprise Knowledge Graph (EKG) might progress:

1. _EKG initiation_: At this stage, the organization has just begun using an EKG to develop a capability map. The EKG may be used to store and manage data on the organization's capabilities, but it is not yet fully integrated into the organization's processes and systems.


2. _Extensible platform_: At this stage, the organization has made significant progress in integrating the EKG into its processes and systems, and is using it to manage and update the capability map on an ongoing basis. The EKG has become an important tool for storing and organizing data on the organization's capabilities, and is being used to inform decision-making and strategic planning.


3. _Enterprise ready_: At this stage, the EKG is a fully integrated and essential part of the organization's operations. It is being used to manage and update the capability map in real-time, and is providing valuable insights and information to help the organization make informed decisions.


4. _Strategic asset_: At this stage, the EKG is seen as a strategic asset by the organization, and is being used to drive innovation and competitive advantage. It is being used to identify new opportunities and areas for growth, and to develop strategies to build and strengthen the organization's capabilities.


5. _Operational ecosystem_: At this final stage, the EKG has become a key part of the organization's operational ecosystem, seamlessly integrating with other systems and processes to support the organization's operations and decision-making. The capability map is an integral part of this ecosystem, providing a clear and comprehensive view of the organization's capabilities and how they align with its goals and objectives.
