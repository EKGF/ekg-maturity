Without an enterprise knowledge graph, supply chain management would likely involve the use of more traditional methods for storing and organizing information about the supply chain. This might include the use of spreadsheets, databases, or other types of data management systems.

Without the centralized and organized structure of an enterprise knowledge graph, it may be more difficult for an organization to get a comprehensive and up-to-date understanding of its supply chain operations. This could lead to inefficiencies and delays in decision-making, as well as increased risk of disruptions in the supply chain.

In addition, without an enterprise knowledge graph, it may be more challenging for an organization to facilitate collaboration and communication with its supply chain partners. This could lead to a lack of coordination and visibility, which can lead to additional challenges in managing the supply chain effectively.

Overall, without an enterprise knowledge graph, supply chain management may be less efficient and more prone to disruptions, which could result in increased costs and other challenges for the organization.
