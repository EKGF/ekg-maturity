## What are the five maturity levels of business scalability assessment?

The five maturity levels of business scalability assessment are a framework for evaluating the current level of scalability of a business and 
identifying areas for improvement. These levels are:

1. _Initial_: At this level, a business has minimal scalability, with little ability to handle increased demand or growth.


2. _Repeatable_: At this level, a business has established processes and systems in place that allow it to handle increased demand in a consistent and predictable manner.


3. _Defined_: At this level, a business has fully documented processes and systems in place, enabling it to easily replicate its operations and handle increased demand.


4. _Managed_: At this level, a business has advanced systems and processes in place to actively monitor and manage its scalability, allowing it to quickly adapt to changing 
   demand.


5. _Optimized_: At this level, a business has fully optimized its systems and processes for scalability, allowing it to handle large increases in demand with ease.


By regularly assessing its scalability maturity level, a business can identify areas for improvement and take steps to increase its ability to handle increased demand and growth. This can help the business grow and succeed in a competitive market.

## Which role will EKG play at each maturity level?

The role of an enterprise knowledge graph (EKG) varies depending on the maturity level of the business. In general, however, an EKG can help a business at any level by
providing a centralized, structured repository of knowledge that can be easily accessed and used by employees.

At the initial level, an EKG can help a business by providing a foundation for organizing and storing knowledge, allowing it to better manage its information and make more
informed decisions.

At the repeatable level, an EKG can help a business by enabling it to easily share and access knowledge across the organization, improving collaboration and consistency.

At the defined level, an EKG can help a business by providing a structured and standardized way to represent knowledge, making it easier to analyze and use.

At the managed level, an EKG can help a business by providing real-time insights and analytics, allowing it to actively monitor and manage its knowledge and make more 
informed decisions.

At the optimized level, an EKG can help a business by providing a comprehensive view of its knowledge and enabling it to leverage advanced AI technologies to drive
innovation and growth.
