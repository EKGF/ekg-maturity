### Contribution to the Enterprise

While practices around Performance Management might
vary across enterprises, we highlight below a few
focus areas where EKGs can act as effective enablers:

_Business Identities_ can act as the common contexts for
aligning strategic and operational performance management.
Highly engaged senior executives practice these links to
drive effective alignment with feedback through their
own mental models of linkage.
EKG-driven feedback mechanisms, based on _business identities_,
can then replicate such links and operate with more objectivity
by enabling decision-making through links of operational
activities and their metrics to the associated business goals,
values and customer propositions.

Contracts can act as common contexts for aligning operations
and role performance management.
Employee contracts can be the most concrete form of expectation
specification and management and their linkage to operations
and the associated propositions of the enterprise to its
customers and other stakeholders can help in aligning appraisals
more objectively to operations and enterprise performance.
