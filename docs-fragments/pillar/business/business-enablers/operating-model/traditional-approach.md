The development of an operating model without an enterprise knowledge graph would typically involve the following steps:

1. _Identify the key components of the operating model_: This might include processes, systems, resources, and roles and responsibilities.


2. _Determine the relationships between these components_: For example, a process may depend on a particular system or resource, or a role may be responsible for a particular process.


3. _Document the operating model_: This might involve creating a written description or a visual representation of the operating model, such as a flowchart or diagram.


4. _Communicate the operating model to relevant stakeholders_: It is important to ensure that all relevant parties within the organization are aware of and understand the operating model. This might involve holding meetings or presentations to explain the model and its components.


5. _Refine and update the operating model as needed_: As the organization evolves and the business environment changes, it may be necessary to update the operating model to ensure that it continues to support the organization's goals and objectives.

Without an enterprise knowledge graph, the development of an operating model may involve more manual effort and may be more prone to errors or inconsistencies. It may also be more difficult to update and maintain the operating model over time, as it may be scattered across various documents or stored in different locations.
