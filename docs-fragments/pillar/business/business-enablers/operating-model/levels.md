The maturity levels of developing an operating model with an enterprise knowledge graph can be described as follows:

1. _EKG Initiation_: At this stage, the organization is just beginning to explore the use of an enterprise knowledge graph to represent its operating model. The focus is on understanding the potential benefits and limitations of using a knowledge graph, and on developing a basic understanding of how to create and maintain a knowledge graph.


2. _Extensible Platform_: At this stage, the organization has implemented an enterprise knowledge graph and is using it to represent key components of its operating model. The focus is on expanding the scope and complexity of the knowledge graph, and on developing the skills and capabilities needed to maintain and update the graph as the operating model evolves.


3. _Enterprise Ready_: At this stage, the enterprise knowledge graph is being used to represent the full scope of the organization's operating model and is integrated with other systems and processes. The focus is on optimizing the use of the knowledge graph and on developing advanced skills and capabilities in using the graph to support decision-making and strategy execution.


4. _Strategic Asset_: At this stage, the enterprise knowledge graph has become a key strategic asset for the organization, and is being used to drive innovation and differentiation. The focus is on leveraging the knowledge graph to support business growth and to create new value for customers.


5. _Operational Ecosystem_: At this stage, the enterprise knowledge graph has become an integral part of the organization's operational ecosystem and is being used to support a wide range of business functions. The focus is on continuously improving the use of the knowledge graph to support the organization's goals and objectives.
