1. _Driving strategy execution_: An operating model provides a roadmap for how an organization will operate and execute on its plans. It helps to ensure that resources are being used efficiently and effectively, and that the organization is able to adapt to changing market conditions and customer needs.


2. _Improving efficiency and effectiveness_: By outlining the processes, systems, and resources that an organization uses to produce and deliver its goods or services, an operating model can help to identify inefficiencies and areas for improvement.


3. _Facilitating communication and collaboration_: An operating model can help to clarify roles and responsibilities within an organization and promote better communication and collaboration between teams and individuals.


4. _Enhancing transparency and accountability_: An operating model can help to increase transparency within an organization by outlining how decisions are made and how resources are used. It can also help to promote accountability by clearly defining roles and responsibilities.


5. _Facilitating change management_: An operating model can provide a framework for implementing and managing changes to an organization's processes, systems, and resources.


6. _Supporting business continuity_: An operating model can help to ensure that an organization is able to continue operating in the event of unexpected disruptions or challenges.


7. _Aligning business and IT_: An operating model can help to align the business and IT functions of an organization by outlining how they work together to deliver value to customers.
