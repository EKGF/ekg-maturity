### Contribution to the EKG

Since an operating model reflects the business needs for standardization
across a company and its business units, it could be a great input for
the development of reusable business vocabularies as part of the
data infrastructure of an enterprise as later explained in the
[data part of this work](/pillar/data/).
These vocabularies may, in turn, be converted to machine-readable models.
Such machine-readable models are called ontologies.

### Contribution to the Enterprise

The operating model could help organizations define their requirements
and expectations in terms of standardization and integration across
business units.
This would be useful to harmonize business capabilities and glossaries
across companies and their business units.

Furthermore, an operating model may serve as input to the development
of an Enterprise Architecture that serves as the organizing logic for
business processes and IT infrastructure based on the companyâ€™s
standardization and integration requirements.
