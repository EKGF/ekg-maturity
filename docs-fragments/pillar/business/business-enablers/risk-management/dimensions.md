!!! warn

    Work in progress, this is just the results of an initial
    brainstorm session, needs to be worked out

1. External risk: Are threats identified (according to but not
   exclusive to your SWOT analysis)?
   - Do you have a threat-matrix?
   - Is there a threat-risk score?
2. External risk: Cyber-threats, have they been identified?
3. Preventable risks
4. Strategy risks
5. Scoring risks:
6. Is the risk-appetite defined by the board?
7. How do you translate identified risks or threats into action?
