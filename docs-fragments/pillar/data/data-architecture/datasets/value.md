### Contribution to the EKG

Having the Value Chain(s) of an organization defined can help with the selection,
definition and prioritization of the right use cases for the EKG.

### Contribution to the Enterprise

In the EKG context, a "digital twin" of a company's value chain can
be modelled where all the various components of the value chain are
represented e.q. all details around logistics, supply chains,
operations, services, marketing, sales and all support activities.
At higher levels of maturity, all real-world details of these
components are available as well and represent the reality accurately
and in real-time.
