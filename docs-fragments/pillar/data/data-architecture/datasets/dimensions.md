    Work in progress, this is just the results of an initial
    brainstorm session, needs to be worked out

1. Did you identify the value proposition of your organization? Scale 1-5
    - Is your value proposition supported by value streams? Scale 1-5
2. Does each value stream provide an identifiable and measurable 
   flow of value ? Scale 1-5
3. Is each Value Stream an executable model (and is it actually 
   executed)? Scale 1 to 5.
    - Note: this is “just” about the Value Stream model itself, 
      not about executing all related models as well.
      Development value streams (DVS) are the sequence of 
      activities needed to convert a  Value Stream model into a 
      digitally enabled Solution.
4. Do you know what percentage of any given change management plan 
   relies on proven steps?
    - TODO: Work this one out further
