Data management policies and standards should be 
crafted to cover the specifics of the knowledge graph.
Candidate areas for EKG-related policies include those 
associated with the management of data catalogs,
the resolution of identity and data meaning, the 
standards for data modeling and metadata,
the use of _Sources of Record_ (SORs) or 
_authorized distribution points_ 
and the control over data entitlements.
