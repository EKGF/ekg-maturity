The _Operating Model_ for the _Center of Excellence for the EKG_ (CoE) 
establishes a new way of running the organization to enable companies
to accelerate development and operate more efficiently.
The EKG governance framework focuses on combining new data capabilities
(i.e. resolvable identity, standard ontologies, open standards)
as part of an integrated process.
A well-defined operating model specifies architecture components 
that support flexible and reusable data to help organizations 
achieve improvements in revenue, customer experience and cost.
