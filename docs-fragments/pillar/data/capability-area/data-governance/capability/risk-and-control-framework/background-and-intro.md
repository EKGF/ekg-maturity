Control processes in the EKG environment are managed
as a structured set of executable business rules
or models---in the EKG, and automatically enforced 
across all use cases.
The meaning of the data is structurally validated at 
the point of data capture to prevent bad data from
entering the EKG at ingestion.
In the knowledge graph, data and metadata are fully 
integrated to ensure reusability across systems
and operational processes.
The EKG is able to map data flow including all 
dependencies and transformations to verify that
data is obtained from authorized _Sources of Record_ (SORs),
identified according to access rights and aligned 
with intended usage.
