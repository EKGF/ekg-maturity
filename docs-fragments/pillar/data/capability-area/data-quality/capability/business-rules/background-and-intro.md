Data quality is an integrated feature of the EKG.
Data quality rules are linked to structured 
business vocabularies to ensure that meaning is 
shared and not obscured by vague terms or cryptic codes.
The logic of business rules and policies is captured and
expressed as executable models and consistently enforced 
across all systems and processes.
These quality constraints (models) allow firms to measure
the quality of the data and perform verification across
disparate systems.
In the mature EKG, violations of logic or integrity are 
identified and prevented before data enters the system.
