## Maturity Level 1

- [ ] Business terms for [EKG use cases](https://method.ekgf.org/concept/use-case/) are captured
      and mapped to an ontology (possibly as simple labels)

## Maturity Level 2

- [ ] Relevant terms (for [EKG use cases](https://method.ekgf.org/concept/use-case/)) are associated 
      with the use case independently of their corresponding ontologies

## Maturity Level 3

- [ ] Existing glossaries within the organization, within the scope of supported use cases,
      are mapped to ontologies and imported into the EKG
- [ ] Terms are grouped into vocabularies for reuse in different communities
- [ ] Vocabularies include local textual definitions as well as being mapped to ontologies
- [ ] Community level vocabularies able to import common vocabularies reusable in many communities:
      allow for multiple levels from local to global
- [ ] Support for synonyms and abbreviations within vocabularies
- [ ] Vocabularies use general principles of modularity
- [ ] Ontologies presented to different communities in their own language
- [ ] Natural language used for definitions links to other terms used
- [ ] Terms are searchable via the knowledge graph interface
- [ ] Generate vocabularies from existing data models or ontologies
- [ ] Ontology logic is presented to business users as natural language

## Maturity Level 4

- [ ] Ontology logic is presented to business as natural language
- [ ] EKG is the _authoritative source_ for all terms, scoped by community, context and use case
- [ ] The governance processes for all new terms (and changes) are managed directly within the EKG
- [ ] The results of _ontology inferencing_ are presented in business natural language
- [ ] Use of _ontology logic_ to validate use of _vocabulary terms_
- [ ] Management of homonyms and disambiguation of terms---through being mapped to different concepts
- [ ] Use of business terms in _natural language queries_
- [ ] Techniques for disambiguation e.g. allowing business users to select the intended meaning
- [ ] Use of textual analytics to suggest modifications to vocabulary/ontology (lemmatization)
- [ ] Use of vocabularies to match internal databases or external data sources for linked data,
      and establish `sameAs` links

## Maturity Level 5

- [ ] Terminology is used to support _natural language processing (NLP)_ of _unstructured data_ for the EKG
- [ ] Use of _reference data_ from the EKG to support entity resolution (in EKG context or elsewhere)
