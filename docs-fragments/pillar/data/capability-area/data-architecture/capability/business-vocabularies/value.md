### Contribution to the Enterprise

Parts of large organizations, and the others they
communicate with, often have their own local business language.
Likewise, operational systems---including their data warehouses
and content repositories---use data models and predefined
physical schemas that are designed to serve specific purposes.
The ability of the knowledge graph to link this terminology
with its actual meaning defined via ontologies at its most
granular (atomic) level eliminates confusion over meaning
when data is validated or transformed.
Standalone business glossaries provide useful input but the
terms need to be reconciled to their enterprise-level meaning
via the EKG.
