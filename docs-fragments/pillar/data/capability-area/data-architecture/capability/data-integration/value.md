### Contribution to the Enterprise

Data integration is challenging because data from multiple
sources can have different file formats, data structures,
definitions, and contextual meanings.
Using the EKG during data integration standardizes the
meaning of data and makes the content understandable
to both humans and machines.
Embedding referenceable meaning into the data using
machine-readable standards facilitates automatic validation
and assurance of data quality.
Registering data integration activities into the EKG
generates full data transparency across linked processes.
Finally, ontology-based metadata representations make it
possible to embed business rules and accommodate
different values, identities, and definitions that existed
at various times in the entity lifecycle.
