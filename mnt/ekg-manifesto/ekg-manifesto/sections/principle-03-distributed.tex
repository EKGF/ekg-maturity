\section{Distributed}\label{sec:ekg-principle-distributed}

\Glspl{data-point} for any object may be stored in many physical stores. 
Any access point provides connectivity to all \gls{ekg} content regardless of where it resides.

The physical stores could include traditional databases as well as varied 
Platforms specifically designed for hosting \glspl{ekg}. 
And some which may be hosted outside the enterprise including by information services or governments. 
All seamlessly accessed using W3C (internet-based) protocols which also allow for browser or 
API \textit{linked data} traversal and query.

\paragraph{Rationale}

Federating different systems allows the knowledge available to an enterprise to be accessed as a whole.
It allows best of breed systems to be used for specific purposes, 
and evolved over time without disrupting the \gls{ekg} as a whole.
It allows scalability through adding new hardware, swapping out systems, 
and optimizing access through moving data closer to where it needs to be processed.

\paragraph{Implications} 

The potential for a loose and evolving nature does mean some degree of monitoring of 
access patterns and performance; and service level agreements for vital information access.
