\section{Standards}\label{ekg-principle-standards}

Data, ontologies, definitions and business rules should be compliant with open
standards and transparent governance procedures as defined by recognized standards
bodies.

Where necessary, \gls{ekgf} will work with relevant standards bodies or projects 
to propose new standards or enhance existing ones.

\paragraph{Rationale}

It's important for enterprises to have trust in the quality, 
interoperability and stability of the structures and interfaces 
used in such a strategic investment as an \gls{ekg}.

It provides freedom of choice in being able to mix and match different 
technologies and models, either in a federated \gls{ekg} or over time. 
That includes standards being able to respond to new advances in both 
technology and techniques. 

\paragraph{Implications}

It can sometimes take longer to work with industry partners to reach the 
consensus needed for standardization, and to use change control/governance procedures.
Release cycles may be phased to avoid constantly changing interfaces.
In order to achieve agility some work products may be deployed on standards 
that are have a \textit{provisional} status\,---\,these need to be carefully identified.
