\section{Control}\label{sec:ekg-principle-09-control.tex}

Entitlement, privacy and business policies will be modeled in the \gls{ekg} 
and automatically executed, enforced and audited at the \gls{data-point} level.

The \gls{ekg} can use enterprise and organization knowledge to express 
access not only in terms of access control lists, but in terms of 
business rules, policies, logic and information content. 

\paragraph{Rationale}

Use of the \gls{ekg} itself to control and enforce access allows 
more power and conciseness of policy expression and execution 
while linking to existing enterprise directories.

\paragraph{Implications}

Appropriate enterprise directories should be integarted in the \gls{ekg}.
It can take some thought to design what the policies should be at the business level.
