Widespread digitalization over the last two decades has accelerated the scale, reach and impact of businesses in today\u2019s knowledge economy. Seven of the top ten firms globally by market capitalization at the  time of this writing ( Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, Facebook, Tencent, Alibaba), are representative of this characterization. This underscores the broad expectation that future competitiveness is increasingly focused on embedding and capitalizing knowledge in the  design, delivery and eventual effectiveness of products, services  and activities in business models of Enterprises.</p> <p>What does a knowledge-based differentiated focus in products and  services mean for enterprises? Prevalent characterization of some business models offers some clue:</p> Embedded Finance <p>The emphasis that convenience of financial products is increasingly determined by integrating them seamlessly into non-financial applications and processes. Embedded Finance offers a new, very large addressable market  opportunity worth over $7 trillion in ten years' time, twice the combined value of the world\u2019s top 30 banks today.</p> Subscription Services <p>The emphasis that experience of products and services is  increasingly determined not from broad contours of use over  time but by specific contexts of use at any given time. 78% of international adults in 2021 have subscription services (71% in 2018). And 75% believe that in the future, people will subscribe to  more services and own less physical \"stuff\".</p> Platform Services <p>The emphasis that utility of services is increasingly determined not from clarity of individual service but through convenience of search and similarity of use across a range  of related products and services.

Mechanisms such as Balanced Scorecards to their business performance, emphasising the causal chains coursing through organizational capability, operations and customer propositions, eventually landing into financial performance as an outcome. More recently, there has been an emphasis on key stakeholder metrics such as ESG adding further dimensions to responsible business performance.</p> <p>The paradigm of business performance has largely hinged on organizations directly influencing their customer engagements with their products and services. Indeed, the prevalent use of the term \"customer\" is ingrained as a counterpart to the organizations\u2019 products. Dramatic advances in the digital economy, especially in the area of mobile  and sensor technology over the last 15 years, have highlighted the  perception of value through insights into consumption/use. In other words, the presumed value in organizations\u2019 products and services is increasingly validated through actual insights into consumption/use by consumers.</p> <p>This shift in perspective of an organizations\u2019 products and services as patterns (based on insights) of consumer use is where movements such as design thinking}, customer journey maps etc are increasingly considered as important tools for developing and validating propositions. The \"aha\" and \"viola\" moments from such exercises require further translation into realizing the propositions, which is where practices around agility, DevOps etc. are increasingly mainstream.</p> <p>All these themes and mechanisms of strategy execution through communication, product/service propositions, development/deployment and its performance management largely depend on a human capital  based on participation, expertise and intuition. Organizations wishing to amplify their human capital face a few key  dichotomies to be addressed:</p> Customer vs Consumer <p>Mindset and capability shift from \"Customer market share\" to \"share of (end) consumer value\"</p> Enterprise vs Ecosystem <p>Mindset and capability shift from \u201cProprietary control of customer experiences\u201d to \u201copen collaboration on consumer experiences\u201d</p> Human Machine Continuum <p>Mindset shift from human-scaled to machine-scaled (intelligent and autonomous) business capability</p> <p>Each of the above dichotomies highlights the limitations enterprises face today in extending business capability beyond their organizational boundaries, be it in sourcing information beyond their own channels or collaborating on shared experiences.</p> <p>Addressing these challenges requires enterprises to adopt an exploratory style in executing their strategy<sup>1</sup> which specifically  focuses on sensing and understanding the consumer ecosystem better before  taking decisions and acting (to be aligned to hyper-personalization,  both in retail and business consumer scenarios)</p> <p>To put this \u201cExplorative Execution\u201d into perspective, a useful  mental model is SUDA (Sense, Understand, Decide, Act, a slight variant of John Boyd\u2019s OODA loop), specifically focused on responding/acting  in a dynamic evolving environment. The choice of the mental model is to bring out its contrast with the imperative style mental model of Plan, Do, Check, Act (PDCA), usually used for acting in an environment of more certainty and  predictability.</p> SENSE <p>Accessing actual contents of need and use by consumers easily overwhelms most organizations for a variety of reasons, chief amongst which is the  sheer volume of context-unique interactions which must be checked for   links to an organization\u2019s business interests and intents. Most of this is practiced subjectively and accorded to human expertise and intuition.</p> UNDERSTAND <p>Unlike the carefully curated lens of its products and services, inputs of interest for an organization are generally ambiguous  requiring significant efforts to disambiguate and synthesize. (John Boyd\u2019s Orientation isn\u2019t just a state you\u2019re in; it\u2019s a process.  You\u2019re always orienting.)</p> DECIDE <p>Disambiguated information still isn\u2019t directly actionable as there is a significant element of hypothesis embedded within. This is especially challenging with high prevalence of conflicting  hypotheses in many cases.</p> ACT <p>Filtered sensing, hypothesis-based understanding and scenario-driven  decision-making finally create an actionable context, which the organizational operations can execute.</p> <p>A deeper analysis of the SUDA-loop of \u201cExplorative Execution\u201d brings into focus the following requirements of capability:</p> Identity <p>How can sensing be practiced in a subject domain of multiple identities? How can a shift from form-based to a function-based identity be enabled?</p> Self-describing <p>How can understanding be practiced in a subject domain with  multiple descriptions? How can a shift from structure-based description to a  behavior-based description be enabled?</p> Open world ambiguity <p>How can decision-making be practiced in scenarios which require constant revalidation and conflict resolution, as new facts become known?</p> <p>An EKG is a key organizational capability to enable Explorative Execution using a SUDA mental model, through the following core features:</p> SENSE <ul> <li>Co-existence of multiple identifications based on context and   interpretation instead of the prevalent content based identification</li> <li>How do retail consumers and business consumers use products and services?</li> </ul> UNDERSTAND <ul> <li>Emphasis on meaning through association rather than static descriptions</li> <li>Enhanced collaboration with ecosystem partners through standards on   context sharing rather than lengthy negotiations on content specifics</li> <li>How do the products and services address needs of consumers?</li> </ul> DECIDE <ul> <li>Significant scale in knowledge driven operations through autonomous reasoning</li> <li>Leverage of existing (diverse and federated) content sources instead of   separate curated content repositories</li> <li>How can products and services add more value through effective use?</li> <li>What changes can be made to make products and services more relevant   for (retail and business) consumers?</li> </ul>"}, {"location": "background-and-intro/#business-identity", "title": "Business Identity", "text": "<p>Business Identity is a statement of a company's unique innovation, service,  and/or product based value proposition.

The artifacts take a variety of forms ranging from free-form documentation of manuals, data and process models along different methodologies to  data records and programming repositories. Business Capability Models,  Business Canvas,  Business Reference Architectures etc  have been some of the outputs used to serve as organization-wide  references of activities.</p> <p>The objectives guiding such management are mostly around efficiency of  categorizing, storing and retrieval, focused around \u201cwhat is done\u201d and \u201cwho does it\u201d. The key challenge in efficiency oriented approaches is that the perception can be quite subjective based on the needs of the  departments or teams --- which leads to a variety of approaches across the length and breadth of any enterprise. There are several implications of using such a variety of approaches --- chief amongst which is the reconciliation effect expended every time a  deviation has to be managed, exceptions have to be handled or a change  introduced in any activity. Targeting efficiency of reconciliations through techniques such as  focus-groups, standardization of documentation etc. is a typical response of most organizations.</p> <p>Taking the intuitive notion of a Business Identity (as a conceptual  anchor for an organization\u2019s engagement with its stakeholders)  forward, enterprises can benefit from using a simple, organization-wide  concept anchor focused around \u201cwhy is it done\u201d for its activities. This anchor need not be prescriptive to change the way an organization manages its activities but descriptive to enhance the ability to more effectively leverage information within the artifacts.</p> <p>One candidate for such an intuitive anchor is the contract. In fact, a contract may initially take the form of a memorandum of  understanding (MOU), an agreement outlined in a formal document that may later become a legal contract. If we take the Business Identity as a basis for viewing an  organization\u2019s product and services, a contract can be seen as a  specific engagement around which the activities of various  departments and teams are organized. More specifically, a contract can be seen as a collection of  related commitments, potentially spread over time, which provide the necessary context for any activity in an organization. Interestingly, while it's well-understood that a contract is a  definitive source of specifics around any agreement with  stakeholders, it's currently referred to only in the extreme case  of legal recourse in handling disagreements. Another perception of contracts is that they do not cover all  collaboration contexts which guide activities in an organization.</p> <p>Contracts have several features which help align the  Business Identity with the activities within an enterprise --- and the wider ecosystem, for that matter.</p> <ul> <li>Together with the legal system and societal norms,    contracts provide a contextual basis for belief/trust    between an enterprise and its stakeholders in the ecosystem</li> <li>Contracts are specific to the parties involved and provide    an ideal contextual basis for (hyper)personalisation of    products and services --- through bounded simulation of    contract performance</li> <li>Measures of performance in organizational activities,    such as cost, operational efficiencies and innovation    effectiveness can be aligned to contractual performance contexts</li> </ul> <p>We now look at two key elements of organizational activity (enabled by EKG) aimed at orienting and realizing  business strategy, through the lens of Business Identity and Contracts:</p> <ul> <li>Business Strategy Actuation   is a business identity oriented process that senses,    understands and communicates business outcome-based    assessment data to focus energy and resources on   strategic objectives.   Actuation measurement values are used to assess    whether strategic objectives and associated   business goals are being fulfilled.</li> <li>Business Model Elaboration   is the process of providing further detail of   business strategy.   It may include decision rationale that explains how the   business identity data infrastructure and algorithms    enable the how and why planned actions would   create, deliver, and capture value.</li> <li>Business Enablers utilizes    Business Identity to scope the EKG facts and facets that are needed to    have a single source of truth about each of their Suppliers, Partners and Consumers.   For example, when a Business Identity point to point relationship with the    Identities of all their Customers is enabled, implementers have much    greater clarity about what must be governed, collected, analyzed, and securely stored.</li> </ul> <ol> <li> <p>See Business Strategy \u21a9</p> </li> </ol>"}, {"location": "article/", "title": "Articles", "text": "<ul> <li>Enterprise Architecture</li> <li>Operating Model</li> <li>Business Strategy</li> <li>The value proposition of EKG</li> <li>Introducing the EKG Matrix Plot &amp; KGI Value</li> <li>Meta Maturity Model</li> </ul>"}, {"location": "article/business-strategy/", "title": "Business Strategy", "text": "<p>Antwerp, 2021, Carlos Tubbax.</p>"}, {"location": "article/business-strategy/#what-is-business-strategy", "title": "What is Business Strategy?", "text": "<p>Competitive strategy is about standing out from competitors by offering a unique mix of value. Michael E. Porter defines strategy as:</p> <p>Strategy is the creation of a unique valuable position; involving a different set of activities</p> <p>Valuable positions emerge from three different sources. First, positioning can be based on producing a particular set of products or services. Second, positioning can also be achieved by targeting the needs of a particular customer segment. Third, the last basis for positioning is based on the way customers can be reached as the way to reach a particular segment might differ from other ones even though their needs are very similar. For example, customer could be geographically spread or could be served only through specific channels. Building a strategic position also involves trade-offs in terms of (1) image or reputation, (2) activities and resources, and (3) priorities.</p> <p>Even though these trade-offs might seem undesirable at first sight, they are necessary for a sustainable strategic position according to Porter. These trade-offs reduce the risk of imitation and straddling. The former occurs when a competitor repositions itself to obtain the valuable strategic position of another company. The latter is far more common and occurs when a straddler seeks to obtain the advantages of a valuable strategic position while maintaining its existing position. However, an imitator or straddler may encounter many problems when trying to obtain a strategic position different from the one it already has. For example, a premium retailer may encounter many problems while trying to position itself as a low-price retailer as both positions require different priorities, resources and activities. This transition may even jeopardize the retailer's current strategic position and confuse its consumers by showing them two incongruent images. Therefore, Porter also defines strategy as:</p> <p>Strategy is making trade-offs in competing. The essence of strategy is choosing what not to do.</p> <p>Positioning determines not only what activities a company will carry out and how it will set up individual activities but also how activities relate to one another. The latter characteristic is called fit and the most valuable fit is strategy-specific because it enhances a position\u2019s uniqueness and amplifies trade-offs. Creating a fit between activities that is difficult to imitate also creates a sustainable strategic position. Finally, Michael E. Porter also defines strategy as:</p> <p>Strategy is creating fit among a company\u2019s activities.

Some benefits of integration are increased efficiency, coordination,    transparency, and agility.

An example of a Diversification company whose business units adopted different operating models is Johnson &amp; Johnson. J&amp;J\u2019s U.S. pharmaceutical group applies a Coordination operating model in which there is a single touchpoint with health-care practitioners while their subsidiary Janssen Pharmaceuticals implements a Replication operating model in Europe with highly standardized, low cost processes.

As a result, an operating model offers a company the possibility to create and possess reusable capabilities for long-term growth.

For instance, Airbnb needs to  be able to answer queries such as:</p> <ul> <li>What are the most popular landmarks and neighborhoods in London?</li> <li>Which Airbnb listings are best suited for working nomads?</li> <li>What are the most popular Italian restaurants in New York?</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>Answering these queries may help travelers plan their trips much better and, in turn, Airbnb may increase its  customer value proposition. </p> <p>As a means to answer all these customer queries,  Airbnb uses a knowledge graph represented by the figure on the right.</p> <p>As explained by Chang (2018)<sup>3</sup>, semantic web knowledge graphs  offer the ability of structuring and adding meaning to data  from different sources such as relational databases in a scalable  way to answer these queries.  Additionally, it is far simpler to connect data about a  certain object spread across different data sources with a  knowledge graph than it is with a relational database.  Another advantage of knowledge graphs compared to  relational databases is that new relationships between concepts  or objects can be added to a knowledge graph in a much more  flexible and simpler fashion.   For instance, knowledge graphs can link the concept surfing as  a sport to the concept surfing which Hawaii is known for.  So, if a customer asks Airbnb\u2019s website for surfing destinations,  Hawaii may appear on the query results. This kind of associations might be far more difficult in a  relational environment especially if the data about them  come from different sources with different schemas.</p> <p>By connecting data about places, experiences, homes, restaurants,  etc. as illustrated here, Airbnb is able to answer complicated user queries<sup>4</sup> such as What events, restaurants and  homes are located in Mission District in San Francisco? as shown  on the right and below.</p> <p>In this way, Airbnb is moving forward into becoming an end-to-end  travel platform that serves its customers throughout their entire  journeys instead of only renting listings out.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Food Discovery with Uber Eats: Building a Query Understanding Engine \u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>All You Need to Know to Build a Product Knowledge Graph \u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>Spencer Chang: Scaling Knowledge Access and Retrieval at Airbnb \u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>Xiaoya Wei: Contextualizing Airbnb by Building Knowledge Graph \u21a9</p> </li> </ol>"}, {"location": "intro/", "title": "Intro", "text": "<p>The EKG Maturity Model is a \u201ccontinuous improvement\u201d product of the EKGF.</p> <p>It is intended to be updated based upon the comments of readers and implementers.

It\u2019s up to the \"fixer\" (usually called \"developer\" in most git documentation on the Internet) to decide which tooling they use. One way to do this is to just use the Github website itself but you could also create a so-called \"clone\" of the git repository on your  local machine and use the standard git utility to create a commit or  use an advanced editor like Visual Studio Code that has built-in git and Markdown support. It goes too far to document all the various different ways to do this  in the context of this document. What\u2019s important to know is that, as a fixer, you should always include the issue number in the title of the commit.  For example, if you edit a content page and then commit that change,  you have to make sure that these two things are done before clicking  the \"Propose Changes\" button as shown in the figure above.</p> <p>Use a title for your commit that includes the issue number,  prefixed by <code>#</code>, for example, <code>#123</code> for issue 123. Use a branch name that includes the issue number (no hash as a prefix).</p> <p>The <code>#123</code> in the title will trigger GitHub to move the corresponding issue from the \"To Do\" column to the \"In Progress\" column. Do not use <code>Fixed #123</code> or <code>Close #123</code> because that  will actually close the issue.</p> <p>Once you have done your first commit to a given branch, you\u2019re ready to create a PR.  Many people wait with creating a PR until their last commit is pushed (one issue can involve many commits involving many files, but they all  go to the same branch) but we recommend creating your PR as soon as possible,  after the first commit, because that gives everyone an easier insight  in the progress. Not everyone is up for that, \u201cexposing\u201d their  first draft changes to others, but it\u2019s generally seen as  good practice doing so.

Give your PR a good title (that title goes into the \"changelog\" so be  specific, although not to worry, it can be changed later)  and a description and click the Create Pull Request button.

Most of this is practiced subjectively and accorded to human expertise and intuition.</p> UNDERSTAND <p>Unlike the carefully curated lens of its products and services, inputs of interest for an organization are generally ambiguous  requiring significant efforts to disambiguate and synthesize.

The artifacts take a variety of forms ranging from free-form documentation of manuals, data and process models along different methodologies to  data records and programming repositories. Business Capability Models,  Business Canvas,  Business Reference Architectures etc  have been some of the outputs used to serve as organization-wide  references of activities.</p> <p>The objectives guiding such management are mostly around efficiency of  categorizing, storing and retrieval, focused around \u201cwhat is done\u201d and \u201cwho does it\u201d. The key challenge in efficiency oriented approaches is that the perception can be quite subjective based on the needs of the  departments or teams --- which leads to a variety of approaches across the length and breadth of any enterprise. There are several implications of using such a variety of approaches --- chief amongst which is the reconciliation effect expended every time a  deviation has to be managed, exceptions have to be handled or a change  introduced in any activity. Targeting efficiency of reconciliations through techniques such as  focus-groups, standardization of documentation etc. is a typical response of most organizations.</p> <p>Taking the intuitive notion of a Business Identity (as a conceptual  anchor for an organization\u2019s engagement with its stakeholders)  forward, enterprises can benefit from using a simple, organization-wide  concept anchor focused around \u201cwhy is it done\u201d for its activities. This anchor need not be prescriptive to change the way an organization manages its activities but descriptive to enhance the ability to more effectively leverage information within the artifacts.</p> <p>One candidate for such an intuitive anchor is the contract. In fact, a contract may initially take the form of a memorandum of  understanding (MOU), an agreement outlined in a formal document that may later become a legal contract. If we take the Business Identity as a basis for viewing an  organization\u2019s product and services, a contract can be seen as a  specific engagement around which the activities of various  departments and teams are organized. More specifically, a contract can be seen as a collection of  related commitments, potentially spread over time, which provide the necessary context for any activity in an organization. Interestingly, while it's well-understood that a contract is a  definitive source of specifics around any agreement with  stakeholders, it's currently referred to only in the extreme case  of legal recourse in handling disagreements. Another perception of contracts is that they do not cover all  collaboration contexts which guide activities in an organization.</p> <p>Contracts have several features which help align the  Business Identity with the activities within an enterprise --- and the wider ecosystem, for that matter.</p> <ul> <li>Together with the legal system and societal norms,    contracts provide a contextual basis for belief/trust    between an enterprise and its stakeholders in the ecosystem</li> <li>Contracts are specific to the parties involved and provide    an ideal contextual basis for (hyper)personalisation of    products and services --- through bounded simulation of    contract performance</li> <li>Measures of performance in organizational activities,    such as cost, operational efficiencies and innovation    effectiveness can be aligned to contractual performance contexts</li> </ul> <p>We now look at two key elements of organizational activity (enabled by EKG) aimed at orienting and realizing  business strategy, through the lens of Business Identity and Contracts:</p> <ul> <li>Business Strategy Actuation   is a business identity oriented process that senses,    understands and communicates business outcome-based    assessment data to focus energy and resources on   strategic objectives.

The choice of the mental model is to bring out its contrast with the imperative style mental model of Plan, Do, Check, Act (PDCA), usually used for acting in an environment of more certainty and  predictability.</p> SENSE <p>Accessing actual contents of need and use by consumers easily overwhelms most organizations for a variety of reasons, chief amongst which is the  sheer volume of context-unique interactions which must be checked for   links to an organization\u2019s business interests and intents. Most of this is practiced subjectively and accorded to human expertise and intuition.</p> UNDERSTAND <p>Unlike the carefully curated lens of its products and services, inputs of interest for an organization are generally ambiguous  requiring significant efforts to disambiguate and synthesize. (John Boyd\u2019s Orientation isn\u2019t just a state you\u2019re in; it\u2019s a process.  You\u2019re always orienting.)</p> DECIDE <p>Disambiguated information still isn\u2019t directly actionable as there is a significant element of hypothesis embedded within. This is especially challenging with high prevalence of conflicting  hypotheses in many cases.</p> ACT <p>Filtered sensing, hypothesis-based understanding and scenario-driven  decision-making finally create an actionable context, which the organizational operations can execute.</p> <p>A deeper analysis of the SUDA-loop of \u201cExplorative Execution\u201d brings into focus the following requirements of capability:</p> Identity <p>How can sensing be practiced in a subject domain of multiple identities? How can a shift from form-based to a function-based identity be enabled?</p> Self-describing <p>How can understanding be practiced in a subject domain with  multiple descriptions? How can a shift from structure-based description to a  behavior-based description be enabled?</p> Open world ambiguity <p>How can decision-making be practiced in scenarios which require constant revalidation and conflict resolution, as new facts become known?</p> <p>An EKG is a key organizational capability to enable Explorative Execution using a SUDA mental model, through the following core features:</p> SENSE <ul> <li>Co-existence of multiple identifications based on context and   interpretation instead of the prevalent content based identification</li> <li>How do retail consumers and business consumers use products and services?</li> </ul> UNDERSTAND <ul> <li>Emphasis on meaning through association rather than static descriptions</li> <li>Enhanced collaboration with ecosystem partners through standards on   context sharing rather than lengthy negotiations on content specifics</li> <li>How do the products and services address needs of consumers?</li> </ul> DECIDE <ul> <li>Significant scale in knowledge driven operations through autonomous reasoning</li> <li>Leverage of existing (diverse and federated) content sources instead of   separate curated content repositories</li> <li>How can products and services add more value through effective use?</li> <li>What changes can be made to make products and services more relevant   for (retail and business) consumers?</li> </ul>"}, {"location": "pillar/business/background-and-intro/#business-identity", "title": "Business Identity", "text": "<p>Business Identity is a statement of a company's unique innovation, service,  and/or product based value proposition.

The artifacts take a variety of forms ranging from free-form documentation of manuals, data and process models along different methodologies to  data records and programming repositories. Business Capability Models,  Business Canvas,  Business Reference Architectures etc  have been some of the outputs used to serve as organization-wide  references of activities.</p> <p>The objectives guiding such management are mostly around efficiency of  categorizing, storing and retrieval, focused around \u201cwhat is done\u201d and \u201cwho does it\u201d. The key challenge in efficiency oriented approaches is that the perception can be quite subjective based on the needs of the  departments or teams --- which leads to a variety of approaches across the length and breadth of any enterprise. There are several implications of using such a variety of approaches --- chief amongst which is the reconciliation effect expended every time a  deviation has to be managed, exceptions have to be handled or a change  introduced in any activity. Targeting efficiency of reconciliations through techniques such as  focus-groups, standardization of documentation etc. is a typical response of most organizations.</p> <p>Taking the intuitive notion of a Business Identity (as a conceptual  anchor for an organization\u2019s engagement with its stakeholders)  forward, enterprises can benefit from using a simple, organization-wide  concept anchor focused around \u201cwhy is it done\u201d for its activities. This anchor need not be prescriptive to change the way an organization manages its activities but descriptive to enhance the ability to more effectively leverage information within the artifacts.</p> <p>One candidate for such an intuitive anchor is the contract. In fact, a contract may initially take the form of a memorandum of  understanding (MOU), an agreement outlined in a formal document that may later become a legal contract. If we take the Business Identity as a basis for viewing an  organization\u2019s product and services, a contract can be seen as a  specific engagement around which the activities of various  departments and teams are organized. More specifically, a contract can be seen as a collection of  related commitments, potentially spread over time, which provide the necessary context for any activity in an organization. Interestingly, while it's well-understood that a contract is a  definitive source of specifics around any agreement with  stakeholders, it's currently referred to only in the extreme case  of legal recourse in handling disagreements. Another perception of contracts is that they do not cover all  collaboration contexts which guide activities in an organization.</p> <p>Contracts have several features which help align the  Business Identity with the activities within an enterprise --- and the wider ecosystem, for that matter.</p> <ul> <li>Together with the legal system and societal norms,    contracts provide a contextual basis for belief/trust    between an enterprise and its stakeholders in the ecosystem</li> <li>Contracts are specific to the parties involved and provide    an ideal contextual basis for (hyper)personalisation of    products and services --- through bounded simulation of    contract performance</li> <li>Measures of performance in organizational activities,    such as cost, operational efficiencies and innovation    effectiveness can be aligned to contractual performance contexts</li> </ul> <p>We now look at two key elements of organizational activity (enabled by EKG) aimed at orienting and realizing  business strategy, through the lens of Business Identity and Contracts:</p> <ul> <li>Business Strategy Actuation   is a business identity oriented process that senses,    understands and communicates business outcome-based    assessment data to focus energy and resources on   strategic objectives.   Actuation measurement values are used to assess    whether strategic objectives and associated   business goals are being fulfilled.</li> <li>Business Model Elaboration   is the process of providing further detail of   business strategy.

Focusing on the what rather than on the how often provides the right level of abstraction of complex ecosystems in a way that can be easily digested by business executives and planning teams. Dissecting a business as a set of basic capabilities allows one to view complex organizations and business environments in a wide range of different ways. Additionally, one could zoom in on lower levels of abstraction to reach higher levels of detail depending on the needs of the target audience.</p> <p>Consider the example of the high-level capability called customer 360\u00b0. This capability refers to having a complete picture of the customer and this is a capability many organizations may benefit from. A customer may be called a taxpayer in the context of a government institution, a patient in the context of a hospital and a student in the context of a university. Being able to manage different aspects of a customer might be imperative for many businesses depending on their business strategy. For instance, customer 360\u00b0 as a high-level capability could entail the customer trend analysis and customer management information capabilities as lower-level capabilities.</p> <p>In other words, this means that capabilities are concerns that could be refined into lower-level capabilities that in turn could be further refined. The advantage of functional decomposition in this hierarchical and modular way is that it increases the reusability of capabilities across business lines, enterprises or even industries. Additionally, decomposing capabilities in different levels of abstraction offers a better sense of how capabilities fit in on the overall view of the enterprise.</p> <p>Capabilities should follow certain principles as follows:</p> <ol> <li>Capabilities define what a business does and not how a business does it.    This implies that a capability does not refer to a process or value stream.</li> <li>Capabilities are nouns, not verbs.    To make the distinction between a capability and a process, capabilities should be named with nouns such as    customer management instead of a verb managing customers.</li> <li>Capabilities should be defined in business term and not in technical terms.    Executives and other business professionals should be able to clearly understand what a capability means    ---and take ownership of it---without being bothered with the technical details of the systems    that implement it.</li> <li>Capabilities should be stable (i.e. least volatile) as possible.    There is a fundamental set of high-level capabilities that are necessary to run a business regardless    of the sector of industry it is located in. Additionally, high-level capabilities may rarely change    within an organization unless there are significant changes to its business strategy or organization.</li> <li>Capabilities are not redundant.    Capabilities appear once and only once on a capability maps even though they are shared by more than division,    business line or business unit of an enterprise.</li> <li>There should only be one business capability map per business.    In order to bring transparency across the organization, there should be a single unified and harmonized    business capability map per business.    Therefore, business capabilities spread throughout different business units, divisions, department,    lines of business, etc should be only appear once in the business capability map.</li> <li>Capabilities map to---but are not the same as---business processes, business units,    Lines of Business (LOBs) and value streams.    There is rarely a one-to-one mapping between a business process, a business unit, an LOB or    a value stream, and a capability.    Therefore, mistaking a capability with one these other concepts may result in an overly complex overview of    things that are constantly repeated across the enterprise.    Additionally, we\u2019re trying to understand the what rather than the how and this would not be possible if    capabilities are mistaken with  process-related concepts.</li> <li>Automated capabilities are still business capabilities and not IT capabilities.    Capabilities are owned by the business as they are made by and for the business.    Therefore, a capability that has been automated with an IT system is not an IT capability.    Instead, it is nothing else than an automated business capability.</li> <li>Capabilities are the most valuable when incorporated in the overall pictures of a business\u2019 ecosystem.    While being useful in a stand-alone basis for discussion and planning, capabilities fulfil their biggest    potential by being combined into a larger business capability map that represents the business ecosystem    of an enterprise.</li> </ol> <p>Here is how the maturity levels of developing a capability map with an Enterprise Knowledge Graph (EKG) might progress:</p> <ol> <li> <p>EKG initiation: At this stage, the organization has just begun using an EKG to develop a capability map. The EKG may be used to store and manage data on the organization's capabilities, but it is not yet fully integrated into the organization's processes and systems.</p> </li> <li> <p>Extensible platform: At this stage, the organization has made significant progress in integrating the EKG into its processes and systems, and is using it to manage and update the capability map on an ongoing basis. The EKG has become an important tool for storing and organizing data on the organization's capabilities, and is being used to inform decision-making and strategic planning.</p> </li> <li> <p>Enterprise ready: At this stage, the EKG is a fully integrated and essential part of the organization's operations. It is being used to manage and update the capability map in real-time, and is providing valuable insights and information to help the organization make informed decisions.</p> </li> <li> <p>Strategic asset: At this stage, the EKG is seen as a strategic asset by the organization, and is being used to drive innovation and competitive advantage. It is being used to identify new opportunities and areas for growth, and to develop strategies to build and strengthen the organization's capabilities.</p> </li> <li> <p>Operational ecosystem: At this final stage, the EKG has become a key part of the organization's operational ecosystem, seamlessly integrating with other systems and processes to support the organization's operations and decision-making. The capability map is an integral part of this ecosystem, providing a clear and comprehensive view of the organization's capabilities and how they align with its goals and objectives.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Without an Enterprise Knowledge Graph (EKG), the development of a capability map would likely involve manually gathering data on the capabilities that are important to your organization. This could involve reviewing internal documents, conducting market research, and seeking input from experts within the organization.</p> <p>Once the data has been collected, you would need to manually organize and structure it in a way that allows you to create a visual representation of your organization's capabilities. This could be in the form of a diagram, chart, or other visual tool.</p> <p>Without the EKG, you would also need to find a way to store and manage the data that you have collected. This could involve creating and maintaining manual records, or using a separate database or spreadsheet tool.</p> <p>Finally, you would need to find a way to link the capabilities on the map to related information and resources, such as training materials, best practices, and case studies. This could involve manually searching for and compiling this information, or relying on other tools or systems to help you access and organize it.</p> <p>Overall, the development of a capability map without an EKG would likely be more time-consuming and labor-intensive, as it would involve manually gathering and organizing data, and finding ways to access and link related information and resources. Moreover, certain capabilities may not be able to be implemented with other technologies but EKG.</p> <p>Warn</p> <p>Work in progress, describe how this capability is possibly being delivered today in a non-EKG context and optionally what the issues are that EKG could or should improve</p> <p>A capability map is a visual representation of the capabilities of an organization or business unit.

Executives and other business professionals should be able to clearly understand what a capability means    ---and take ownership of it---without being bothered with the technical details of the systems    that implement it.</li> <li>Capabilities should be stable (i.e. least volatile) as possible.    There is a fundamental set of high-level capabilities that are necessary to run a business regardless    of the sector of industry it is located in. Additionally, high-level capabilities may rarely change    within an organization unless there are significant changes to its business strategy or organization.</li> <li>Capabilities are not redundant.    Capabilities appear once and only once on a capability maps even though they are shared by more than division,    business line or business unit of an enterprise.</li> <li>There should only be one business capability map per business.    In order to bring transparency across the organization, there should be a single unified and harmonized    business capability map per business.    Therefore, business capabilities spread throughout different business units, divisions, department,    lines of business, etc should be only appear once in the business capability map.</li> <li>Capabilities map to---but are not the same as---business processes, business units,    Lines of Business (LOBs) and value streams.    There is rarely a one-to-one mapping between a business process, a business unit, an LOB or    a value stream, and a capability.    Therefore, mistaking a capability with one these other concepts may result in an overly complex overview of    things that are constantly repeated across the enterprise.    Additionally, we\u2019re trying to understand the what rather than the how and this would not be possible if    capabilities are mistaken with  process-related concepts.</li> <li>Automated capabilities are still business capabilities and not IT capabilities.    Capabilities are owned by the business as they are made by and for the business.    Therefore, a capability that has been automated with an IT system is not an IT capability.    Instead, it is nothing else than an automated business capability.</li> <li>Capabilities are the most valuable when incorporated in the overall pictures of a business\u2019 ecosystem.    While being useful in a stand-alone basis for discussion and planning, capabilities fulfil their biggest    potential by being combined into a larger business capability map that represents the business ecosystem    of an enterprise.</li> </ol>"}, {"location": "pillar/business/business-enablers/capability-map/dimensions/", "title": "Dimensions", "text": "<p>Warn</p> <p>Work in progress, this is just the results of an initial brainstorm session, needs to be worked out</p> <ol> <li>Capability Map Coverage: does your capability map cover your    whole business?

This would typically involve interviews and discussions with key stakeholders, as well as a review    of relevant documents and data sources.</p> </li> <li> <p>Collect and organize data: The next step would be to collect and organize the data and information needed to conduct the scalability assessment. This would typically     involve manually gathering data from various sources, such as internal databases, external sources, and interviews with subject matter experts.</p> </li> <li> <p>Analyze and classify the data: The next step would be to analyze and classify the data, to identify the key drivers and barriers to scalability for the organization.    This would typically involve manual analysis and classification, using techniques such as benchmarking, modeling, and simulation.</p> </li> <li> <p>Conduct the scalability assessment: The next step would be to conduct the actual scalability assessment, using the criteria and metrics identified in the previous step.     This would typically involve manually evaluating the data and information collected and analyzed in previous steps, and comparing it to industry benchmarks and best     practices.</p> </li> <li> <p>Review and refine the assessment: The final step would be to review and refine the scalability assessment, based on feedback from stakeholders and further analysis.

and the challenges of expressing conceptual nuance using multiple informal sentences. In the other direction, from ontology to vocabulary, it should be possible to generate a business glossary directly from ontologies for a given scope. Since they should capture the meaning of concepts applicable to an organization, or an even broader ecosystem, the choice of concepts to include in an EKG should be driven by business use cases. And different overlapping ontologies may be included and mapped to cover different relevant aspects. Likewise, it should be possible to generate---and map to---models for more conventional tools from ontologies, by applying technology-specific rules.</p> <p>Semantic modeling also eliminates the problem of hard-coding assumptions about the world into a single data model. And while multiple ontologies may coexist, they are able to be mapped and connected to each other. In a mature environment, the data modeling process drives technology implementation, by defining the detailed data structures and associated APIs. These components---along with functional code---are included as part of the testing suite within the EKG to facilitate rapid deployment.</p> <p>Different types of external data models are not needed in EKG but can be mapped to or generated.

Different ontologies may be used for different contexts and mapped to each other in the underlying knowledge graph.</p> <p>Ontology elements are linked to by vocabularies and mapped to other data models and datasets to provide their meaning; and from Use Cases to provide their scope.

For example, you cannot rely on the name of a column in a spreadsheet. A deceptively simple column name such as \"number of European customers\" leaves open the meaning of \"European\" and \"customer\" and timing (when does one start and stop being a customer?). And different sources could have different interpretations of that same name. The benefit is consistency, accuracy and the ability to make sound business decisions. Having the models themselves be resources that can be looked up means that all data is self-defining and carries its meaning with it. In an EKG there is no fixed set of ontologies so it can non-disruptively incorporate additional knowledge.

It is based on an understanding of application requirements and derived by reverse engineering of the data production process. A data quality framework is an agreed methodology including operational controls, governance processes and measurement mechanisms. The framework is designed to support organizational priorities for data quality based on criticality and business value.</p> <p>Data Quality business rules ensure that the data is fit for its intended purpose. SMEs specify the criteria used to validate and enforce data integrity.
