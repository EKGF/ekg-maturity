What is Business Strategy? \u00b6 Competitive strategy is about standing out from competitors by offering a unique mix of value. Michael E. Porter defines strategy as: Strategy is the creation of a unique valuable position; involving a different set of activities Valuable positions emerge from three different sources. First, positioning can be based on producing a particular set of products or services. Second, positioning can also be achieved by targeting the needs of a particular customer segment. Third, the last basis for positioning is based on the way customers can be reached as the way to reach a particular segment might differ from other ones even though their needs are very similar. For example, customer could be geographically spread or could be served only through specific channels. Building a strategic position also involves trade-offs in terms of (1) image or reputation, (2) activities and resources, and (3) priorities. Even though these trade-offs might seem undesirable at first sight, they are necessary for a sustainable strategic position according to Porter. These trade-offs reduce the risk of imitation and straddling. The former occurs when a competitor repositions itself to obtain the valuable strategic position of another company. The latter is far more common and occurs when a straddler seeks to obtain the advantages of a valuable strategic position while maintaining its existing position. However, an imitator or straddler may encounter many problems when trying to obtain a strategic position different from the one it already has. For example, a premium retailer may encounter many problems while trying to position itself as a low-price retailer as both positions require different priorities, resources and activities. This transition may even jeopardize the retailer's current strategic position and confuse its consumers by showing them two incongruent images. Therefore, Porter also defines strategy as: Strategy is making trade-offs in competing. The essence of strategy is choosing what not to do. Positioning determines not only what activities a company will carry out and how it will set up individual activities but also how activities relate to one another. The latter characteristic is called fit and the most valuable fit is strategy-specific because it enhances a position\u2019s uniqueness and amplifies trade-offs. Creating a fit between activities that is difficult to imitate also creates a sustainable strategic position. Finally, Michael E. Porter also defines strategy as: Strategy is creating fit among a company\u2019s activities. The success of a strategy depends on doing many things well---not just a few---and integrating among them.","title":"Business Strategy"},{"location":"article/business-strategy/#what-is-business-strategy","text":"Competitive strategy is about standing out from competitors by offering a unique mix of value.

Additionally, they should have a risk strategy focused on safeguarding their business capabilities, customers, and digital assets from growing threats. That strategy should be based on a risk event analysis that identifies: Undesirable Outcome & Threat causal relationship e.g. Supplier communication breach Threat Severity e.g. Catastrophe via infrastructure failure; Slow Burn via climate change Vulnerability of at-risk Business Capability e.g. Digital asset storage not protected Probability of Risk e.g. Layer of Protection Analysis per event frequency The Risk Strategy must also have knowledge about the business Tolerance to Risk. Which requires an assessment focused on the strength / weakness of each safeguard and its ability to mitigate one or more Threats. Further, it requires the business to determine Acceptance Level limits for the Vulnerabilities that exist, the Business Capabilities that are at-risk and the exposure that would have an Undesirable Outcome. To help measure changes in probabilities-of-risk the business should use a Key Risk Indicator (KRI) . For example, when used for continuous risk event analysis the KRI(s) would signal any changes in risk exposure and help identify the business capabilities that require a safeguard investment. Sustainability \u00b6 A Sustainable Risk Assessment (SRA) is designed to help decision makers understand how potential data protection threats (and other challenges) may impact strategic objectives. The assessment may be as simplistic as the two factor (Morningstar.com) Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) rating. Which considers, the \"Exposure\" that measures a company\u2019s vulnerability or susceptibility to risk, and the \"Management\" actions taken to address a risk issue. The assessment may employ a Qualitative risk technique, such has, a probability and impact matrix, a risk categorization, a risk frequency ranking, or a risk urgency prioritization. It may also use a Quantitative risk method that employs weighted outcome, probability ratio and expected Business Value analysis. Finally, it may employ a multiple factor scoring methodology, similar to the CDP global disclosure system that recognizes participation in Climate Change, Water, Forests and Supply Chain programs 1 . Exemplar KRI & Risk Factor KRI: Number of Notifications Received from Regulators reflects total number of notifications that the business receives from regulators during the measurement period. Risk Factor: A high volume of notifications can be an indicator of weak compliance controls which may increase exposure to financial, reputational and operational risk . Strategy \u00b6 A Risk Management Strategy should include a process for regularly updating and reviewing essential factors based on the outcomes from actions taken to continuously identify, assess and manage the known risk. It may also leverage a Sustainability Risk Management Framework that references the essential factors and their relationship with the measurable dimensions of key objectives - Value chain drivers; Risk exposure; Response design; Value Outcomes; Performance 2 . Exemplar KRI & Risk Factor KRI: Percentage of Key Performance Indicator (KPI) Targets Not Met reflects the number of objectives that have targets which are not being achieved. Risk Factor: An indication that the management of a large number of objectives is unsatisfactory may expose the company to operational, financial and reputational harm. Portfolio \u00b6 To support Portfolio-level analysis a quantitative risk assessment and management framework identified the phases of a Value of Asset driven analysis > scenario identification > consequence and criticality assessment > security vulnerability assessment > threat likelihood assessment, > benefit-cost analysis 3 . Key to this methodology is the use of plausible threat scenarios based on a target susceptibility and a threat likelihood assessment that captures adversary tendencies to shift their preferences in response to security investments. Exemplar KRI & Risk Factor KRI: Value at Risk (VaR) reflects the probability that asset losses will occur within a given portfolio over a given period of time and can be calculated using historical data and/or proprietary models. Risk Factor: The probability could be based on a worst case situation where the amount is a realized loss and there is an order of magnitude harm to reputation. Project \u00b6 A Project Risk Analysis assesses how a Vulnerability would impact the targets set for key Objectives, such as, Project Cost, Delivery Schedule, Technical Performance and Business Value. Moreover, when there are many Threats the determination of Project Priorities would likely use a most-to-least-critical importance ranking 4 . Further, to ensure the prioritization algorithm accurately reflects needs All the Factors of All Objectives should be included e.g. factor in Time Criticality as part of the calculation for the Scheduling Objective . Exemplar KRI & Risk Factor KRI: Percentage of Projects Currently in Progress That are Delayed reflect measurements of all the issues that delayed any project. Risk Factor: Excessive project delays expose the business to financial, strategic, operational and reputational risk. Technology \u00b6 To help Secure Critical Information Infrastructure the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security has created an evaluation Framework 5 . It primarily consists of a logic model presenting a set of steps and a list of possible KPIs that map to the objectives of the evaluation model. Exemplar KRI & Risk Factor KPIs: Identification of Critical Information infrastructures. Performance Factors: Evidence of registries of business capability specific critical assets, dependencies, risks, vulnerabilities Risk Assessment and Risk Management Procedures / Plans. Performance Factors: Evidence of definitions of risk centric procedures that have a stated frequency of knowledge updates Business Recovery and Continuity Plans for Critical Infrastructures. Performance Factors: Evidence of strategic documents - implementation guides, Use Case Tree , RACI (responsible, accountable, consulted, informed) Chart Successful Information Sharing and Trusted Cooperation. Performance Factors: Evidence of trusted channels for communication; Enterprise Knowledge Graphs for stakeholders, partners and participants Transparency and Accountability of Systems. Performance Factors: Evidence of different types of documentation available to the public e.g. Knowledge Graph KRI: Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) reflects the stability of systems following a resumption of service that had been suspended due to failure. Risk Factor: A large value for this metric may indicate that systems are unstable and underlying architecture must be further examined. Knowledge \u00b6 When Assessing Risk it can be readily accepted that accumulated Knowledge leads to a better awareness of What has greater Certainty and What remains Uncertain . Moreover, to have a culture of security, it is critical that all the strategic decision makers (Business Capability stakeholders, Project Engineers and others in key roles) share a common understanding of What is at Risk . That shared knowledge may be the core content of a Business Capability Portfolio (BCP) that is purposed to assure that Business Capabilities are attuned to a Sustainable Risk Appetite, protected by a Risk Management Strategy, and provisioned by Risk Mitigation Technology. Exemplar KRI & Risk Factor KRI: Risk Larger Than Appetite reflects that current Risk score is greater than the amount of risk the business is willing to accept to achieve its objectives. Risk Factor: The more the risk score exceeds Risk Tolerance the greater the probability the business is exposed to catastrophic financial, strategic, operational and reputational damage. Next Steps \u00b6 The task of populating a BCP will likely employ a digitization process that converts the characteristics of a physical object / process into a digital form and, as a Value-Add, create a Digital Twin (DT) 6 construct. Moreso, to provide operations intelligence that span its lifecycle, The BCP would have Use Case Tree connections to Knowledge Graphs, KPIs, KRIs and the Business Capability that leverage it. As in, Safeguard physical properties declared in a Knowledge Graph are used to accurately represent how connected entities (e.g. Customers, Partners, Sales, Products, Locations) are protected in real life. Further, when the safeguard (DT) uses digital objects (representing images, sounds, signals) the response to physical warnings (sounds, flashing lights) can be better calibrated. Moreover when a Vulnerability is discovered, the Use Case Tree (of connected nodes) may be actuated to simulate how a proposed change in behavior could mitigate specific risks.

To help measure knowledge growth the Enterprise Knowledge Graph ( EKG ) Maturity Model provides a single metric for an entire Enterprise\u2019s utilization. To qualitatively identify maturity trends the Model is structured with Pillars . To quantitatively measure maturity success the Model supports the use of dimension-specific data points. Additionally, to help explain the investment created at \"Maturity\" the dimensions may be used to formulate Business Value metrics. To assess value, many in the investment community use Economic Value Added (EVA) and Value Based Management (VBM) . EVA, also known as economic profit , aims to measure the True Value that a firm creates through its operation. VBM is a framework that is focused on having the EVA being a sustainable value. Often the first VBM step is determining the variations of a dimension that correctly measure that value. Value To Be Measured \u00b6 Value analysts often use data science methods and computational art mechanisms to correctly measure dimensions. Especially, when algorithmic parameters must be used to convert Business Value dimensions into Key Performance Indicators . Moreso, when the complexity of the innovation 2 requires a dimension scope supporting the objectives of Sustainability ; Innovation Strategy ; Portfolio Management ; Project Management ; Technology Management and Knowledge Management . Such as: Sustainability \u00b6 For Sustainability to be maintained at a certain rate or level, the objective would likely include all forms of Business Value that indicate the health and well-being of an enterprise. The most likely core objective would be to have a Value Proposition that gives the customer the reason to choose their offering. Another likely objective would be the Value Stream Management focused on the flow of Value Chain activities performed when validating a product-market proposition. Innovation Strategy \u00b6 Innovation Strategy often has an objective to have unique products that differ significantly from those of competitors. When Differentiation Innovation is an objective the USP (Unique Selling Point) would provide a clear Value Proposition. There may also be Strategic Decision to introduce a Value Innovation objective of having Differentiation at Lower Cost. Which may be measured via Expected Monetary Value (EMV) Analysis that compares cost, e.g. design, marketing, packaging, to product revenue. Portfolio Management of Value \u00b6 Portfolio Management of Value may be based on the objective that innovation resources are only invested in assets that deliver true value. True Value Statistically, True Value is obtained with perfect measuring instruments (without committing any error of any type) both in collecting the primary data and in carrying out mathematical operations. Computationally, Return On Investment may be calculated by subtracting the amount invested from the asset value; Total Portfolio Valuation may be based on the value of all assets owned. Which in turn may use Benefits realization management (BRM) techniques to identify the True Value of an asset. Project Management \u00b6 Project Management can be considered a success if it delivers on an objective that has a predetermined Business Value. That determination may use Value Stream mapping to create a visual guide of the changes necessary for that delivery. Additionally, Project Value may be expressed using Business Case rationale that evaluates the benefit, cost and risk of alternatives. Stakeholder Value may also be recognized for those with tangible objectives. Such as, performs better; is easier or more convenient to use; is more reliable; is more durable; is more available to more customers. Technology Management \u00b6 Technology Management is recognized as a Value Driver when it enhances Business Capabilities that add profitability, reduce risk, and promote asset growth. For instance, Technology may be treated as a Value Driver when it is used to transform data into an economic asset. As in, the resulting \"Data Asset\" is used to improve operations, increase revenue, solidify relationships with stakeholders, produce new revenue streams, improve the quality of current products, establish competitive differentiation, allow innovation, and reduce risks. Knowledge Management \u00b6 Knowledge Management (KM ) has historically been defined as the structured development, transfer, dissemination and application of knowledge. More forward-looking thinking, Paoloni c.s. 3 has KM being key to innovation and is a component of entrepreneurial capital or intellectual capital. Moreover, Indra Abeysekera 4 identified that KM and Intellectual Capital have become inseparable partners in enterprise value creation. Especially when Knowledge Value Chain tasks result in embedded knowledge products / services that have a unique competitive advantage or social benefit.

Once a company has defined one or several operating models depending on its business process integration and standardization requirements, it can then draw its enterprise architecture that reflects the company\u2019s key processes, systems, and data embedded at the company's core. More formally, an Enterprise Architecture is defined by Ross, Weil, and Robertson (p. 47, 2006) as the organizing logic for business processes and IT infrastructure reflecting the integration and standardization requirements of the company's operating model. It is essential to effective enterprise architecture to identify the processes, data, technologies, and customer interfaces that take the operating model from vision to reality as explained by Ross, Weil and Robertson (2006). These key elements are different for each of the four operating models. Core Diagrams \u00b6 A core diagram is a one-page picture of the high-level view of the processes, data, and technologies needed as a foundation for execution. The purpose of this core diagram is to facilitate discussions between IT and business managers to help clarify requirements for the company's foundation for execution and communicating the vision. Although each core diagram can be unique to each organization, four common elements can be found almost in any core diagram, which are listed as follows: Core business processes: This small set of processes constitute the stable set of company-wide capabilities that the company needs to execute its operating model and respond to market opportunities. Shared data driving core processes: This is data shared across different end-to-end business processes by all the parties participating in these processes, such as business units or even suppliers. Key linking and automation technologies: There are different technologies that fall within this category. First, middleware technologies that enable integration of applications and access to shared data such as ERP packages, data-warehouses, and knowledge graphs, are the first kind of these technologies. Moreover, portals providing standardized access to systems and data are the second type of these technologies. Finally, electronic interfaces facing stakeholders, such as suppliers, employees and partners could also appear on the company\u2019s core diagram. Key customers: These show the company's primary customer groups (e.g., channels or segments). The four different types of core diagrams are discussed in the following subsections. Unification Model \u00b6 The core diagram for a Unification Model is shown in figure 1. Integration and standardization of business processes is necessary to serve key customer types in a Unification model. The top of figure 1 identifies the necessary and optional elements for business process designing, which are: identifying key customers, identifying and showing the key processes to be integrated and standardized, identifying and showing the key data imperative to better integrate and standardize processes and serve customers, and identifying and showing the key technologies that either automate or link processes (this optional as depicted by the dashed outline). This core diagram provides a high-level overview of a company's enterprise architecture with highly standardized and integrated processes implementing a Unification operating model. Figure 1: Core Diagram Design Process4 \u00a92005 MIT Sloan Center for Information Systems Research and IMD Diversification Model \u00b6 Since the diversification model entails the least amount of business process standardization and integration, it is the opposite of the unification model. In a unification model, each business unit functions more or less independently even though there can be opportunities for shared services across the company. Figure 2: Diversification Operating Model Core Diagram4 \u00a92005 MIT Sloan Center for Information Systems Research and IMD An extreme example of a Diversification model would be a total lack of an enterprise architecture in which there is no collaboration nor communication between business units. However, these business units could benefit from economies of scale by adopting a shared technology platform and are the key elements of the core diagram in figure 2. Such shared technologies and services could take the form of data centers, telecommunications networks, help desks, offshore systems development and maintenance capability, centralized vendor negotiations, etc. If different business units may benefit from shared services and technologies, they could depict that in the core diagram of the company. Additionally, if business units may also benefit from certain shared data, they could also add that to the company's core diagram. Since shared platforms are the most important component of a core diagram of a company implementing a diversification model, start with the technologies that---when shared---could provide economies of scale, standardization, or other benefits. The other remaining key elements---key customer types, shared processes, and data---should only be incorporated to the extent that they are common between business units and necessary for the operating model. For example, some data should be modelled in the core diagram as it may be shared at corporate level for financial reporting, risk management, and compliance across different business units. Coordination Model \u00b6 A company implementing a coordination model uses a high amount of business process integration to offer a service or product to each customer group. This high amount of integration results from sharing key data across business units to present a common face to the customer. Coordination allows companies to integrate many processes or products to the customer in a black-box fashion without forcing high levels of standardization. The enterprise architecture core diagram for the Coordination operating model depicts the emphasis on integration and thus on shared data within a company. Commonly, the core diagram will also show important technologies used by stakeholders to access this shared data. Processes could also be shown in the core diagram if they need to be coordinated across business units. However, processes are often not depicted in the core diagram of a coordination model as they are mostly unique and can differ to a great extent across business units. Figure 3: Coordination Operating Model Core Diagram4 \u00a92005 MIT Sloan Center for Information Systems Research and IMD Replication Model \u00b6 A Replication operating model is recommended when key processes need to be highly standardized but not integrated across the company by means of an automating technology. Standardized processes is the key concept in Replication operating models. So, key standard processes and, often, the key technologies enabling those processes are the first things shown in the enterprise architecture of a company implementing a Replication operating model. In contrast to that, data rarely appears in the core diagram because business units in a Replication company barely share data. In order to drive up productivity, these companies could also automate key standardized business processes resulting in reusable business modules. When drawing a Replication model core diagram (figure 4), start with the key processes to be standardized and replicated across the business units. Then, identify the technologies automating those key processes. Next, look at the technologies automating those key processes that could eventually be shared across the business units. However, since business units barely share data or have the same customer types as those decisions are made locally, it is not necessary to add them to the core diagram.

Business Operating Model \u00b6 Ross, Weill, Robertson (2006) The operating model is the necessary level of business process integration and standardization for delivering goods and services to customers. An operating model describes how a company wants to thrive and grow. By providing a more stable and actionable view of the company than strategy, the operating model drives the design of the foundation for execution. Defining an operating model in an organization is very important because it enables the adoption of different strategic initiatives as a foundation for execution. Such an operating model represents and reinforces the strategy to be supported. Therefore, the operating model---or the lack of it---has a profound impact on how a company implements business processes and IT. An operating model has two dimensions which are (1) business process standardization and (2) integration: According to Ross, Weil and Robertson (2006), standardization of business processes can be defined as; \u201cdefining exactly how a process will be executed regardless of who is performing the process or where it is completed. Process standardization delivers efficiency and predictability across the company\u201d Business process standardization can lead to large increases in throughput and efficiency. However, it comes at a price since the more business processes are standardized, the more difficult it is to tailor services and products for specific customer needs hampering innovation and business agility in the process. Business process integration coordinates efforts and work across organizations through data. Sharing data can occur between processes to enable end-to-end transaction processing, or across processes to allow the company to present a single face to customers. Some benefits of integration are increased efficiency, coordination, transparency, and agility. However, integration entails a large amount of effort such as in end-to-end integration where companies need to develop standard data definitions and formats that will be shared and used across different business units and functions. Companies adopt an operating model at the enterprise level but could also adopt different operating models at the division, business region, or other level. In order to define an operating model at any of these different levels, companies need to answer the following two questions (Ross, Weil and Robertson (2006)): To what extent is the successful completion of one business unit\u2019s transactions dependent on the availability, accuracy, and timeliness of other business unit\u2019s data? To what extent does the company benefit by having business units run their operations in the same way? The first question determines integration requirements while the second one covers the standardization requirements of an organizations. Depending on these requirements, there are four different possible operating models as depicted in table~\\ref{tab:ekg-maturity-business-operating-model-quadrants}. \u200b \u200b Coordination Unification Business Process Integration High Shared customers, products or suppliers Customers or suppliers may be local or global Impact on other business unit transactions Globally integrated business processes often with support of enterprise systems Operationally unique business units or functions Business units with similar or overlapping responsibilities Autonomous business management Centralized management often applying functional/process/business unit matrix Business unit control over process design High level process owners design standardized processes Shared customer/supplier data Centrally mandated database Consensus process for design of IT infrastructure services IT decisions made centrally _ _ IT application decisions made in business units Low Diversification Replication Few if any shared customers or suppliers Few if any shared customers or suppliers Independent transactions Independent transactions are aggregated at high level Operationally unique business units Operationally similar business units Autonomous business management Autonomous business unit leaders with limited direction over processes Business unit control over process design Centralized control over business process design Few data standards across business units Standardized data definitions, but data locally owned with some aggregation at corporate level _ _ _ _ Most IT decisions made within business units Centrally mandated IT services Low High Business Process Standardization ~~ Figure 1: Operating Model Quadrant \u00a922005 MIT Sloan school of business Each one of these four operating model types is described below: Diversification : low standardization, low integration Coordination : low standardization, high integration Replication : high standardization, low integration Unification : high standardization, high integration Diversification \u00b6 Diversification applies to companies that have different units with few common products, services, customers, or ways of doing business. Central management exerts relatively little control over business units that operate in a highly autonomous way offering their own products and services to their own customers. The Diversification model may offer synergies from related, but not integrated, business units. In this context, business units may create demand for one another or increase the company\u2019s brand recognition which creates enterprise-wide value. Although there could be some synergies between business units, the success of companies with a Diversification model stem from the success of the individual business units and acquisitions of other related businesses. Coordination \u00b6 Business units in a Coordination company usually share one of the following: customers, products, suppliers, and partners. Some benefits of the Coordination model are integrated customer service, cross-selling and transparency across supply chain processes. Whereas key business processes are tightly integrated, business units have unique processes and capabilities. In these companies, low cost is not the main driver as the main driver is delivering the best service and products to the customer while executing business processes in the most efficient way possible. Strong central management defines and prioritizes cooperation. Through integration without a high degree of standardization across business units or functions, growth can be achieved by offering already existing products or services to customer segments in new markets. Additionally, growth can also be achieved by improving services to meet new, but related, customer demands. Replication \u00b6 The Replication model provides autonomy to business units but runs operations in a highly standardized way. The business units are not tightly integrated as they are not dependent on each other\u2019s transactions while they implement a set of highly standardized business processes that can be easily repeated in new business units. McDonald\u2019s and other franchise companies are examples of a Replication company. The advantage of this model is that it enables organizations to build new business units from scratch with relatively little effort. Unification \u00b6 Companies that operate as a highly optimized whole---around a highly standardized set of business processes---% may benefit from the Unification model. Business units in these companies may have relatively very little autonomy and they best maximize efficiencies and customer services by using integrated data and driving variability out of business processes. Unification companies typically have integrated supply chains with interdependencies between distributed business units. These business units share transaction data and standardized business processes. Therefore, these companies may benefit the most from enterprise-wide systems to support company standardization and integration requirements. Management in these companies is highly centralized and plays an important role in driving out inefficiencies to foster growth through economies of scale by introducing new products. Since variability must be minimized in these companies, this model is best suited for companies that compete on price such as those that offer commodities where innovation or customization are not key. Applying the operating model to attain growth \u00b6 An operating model is the underlying logic of how an organization will enable and execute strategies. Each operating model entails its own opportunities for growth. The need to tightly integrate business processes make acquisitions and mergers---for both the buy-side as well as the sell-side---more challenging as disparate data definitions need to be reconciled. However, the tight process integration of the Coordination and Unification models offers opportunities of organic growth through expansion into new markets or extensions of current product lines. Process standardization, as in the Unification and Replication models, enables growth through a rip-an-replace approach to acquisitions. When an acquiring company wants to create a mirror image of itself out of an acquired company, it only has to replace the processes and systems of the acquired business with its own. However, both models do not offer much leverage when a company chooses to expand into operationally distinct lines of business as both models depend on leveraging already existing processes. The Diversification model imposes fewer constraints on the organic growth of individual business units and fewer limits for business acquisitions. However, it does not offer the benefits of integration and standardization across business units. The opportunities for growth of each operating model are shown in table~\\ref{tab:ekg-maturity-business-operating-model-different}. \u200b \u200b Coordination Unification Business Process Integration High Organic: stream of product innovations easily made available to existing customers using existing integrated channels. Organic: leverage economies of scale by introducing existing products/services in new markets; grow product line incrementally. _ _ Acquisition: can acquire new customers for existing products but must integrate data. Acquisition: can acquire competitors to leverage existing foundation; must rip and replace infrastructure. Low Diversification Replication Organic: small business units may feed core business; company grows through business unit growth Organic: replicate best practices in markets; innovations extended globally _ _ _ _ Acquisition: unlimited opportunities; must ensure shareholder value Acquisition: can acquire competitors to expand market reach; must rip and replace Low High Business Process Standardization ~~ Figure 2: Different operating models position companies for different types of growth \u00a92005 MIT Center for Information Systems Research Business units of a company can also adopt different operating models to respond to conflicting demands. For instance, Diversification companies may benefit from allowing their own business units to adopt their own operating models as these business units are highly independent. An example of a Diversification company whose business units adopted different operating models is Johnson & Johnson. J&J\u2019s U.S. pharmaceutical group applies a Coordination operating model in which there is a single touchpoint with health-care practitioners while their subsidiary Janssen Pharmaceuticals implements a Replication operating model in Europe with highly standardized, low cost processes. This gives freedom to each business unit to implement a different operating model depending on its own objectives while maintaining a relatively simple operating model at a corporate level. An operating model gives a company better guidance for developing IT and business process capabilities. It also serves as a stable foundation for strategic endeavours such as mergers and acquisitions. This foundation enables IT to be more proactive in identifying possible strategic opportunities. In order to define an operating model, management needs to define the role of business process standardization and integration. This also requires management to identify the company\u2019s key business processes that create a sustainable competitive advantage for the company. As a result, an operating model offers a company the possibility to create and possess reusable capabilities for long-term growth. In this context, an operating model could be seen as the main driver of strategy at a corporate or business level. In addition, an operating model plays a major role in defining the required architecture, practices, management thinking, policies, and processes as they may be different for each operating model. In other words, an operating model could be a key driver in the design of separate organization units.","title":"Operating Model"},{"location":"article/operating-model/#business-operating-model","text":"Ross, Weill, Robertson (2006) The operating model is the necessary level of business process integration and standardization for delivering goods and services to customers. An operating model describes how a company wants to thrive and grow. By providing a more stable and actionable view of the company than strategy, the operating model drives the design of the foundation for execution. Defining an operating model in an organization is very important because it enables the adoption of different strategic initiatives as a foundation for execution. Such an operating model represents and reinforces the strategy to be supported. Therefore, the operating model---or the lack of it---has a profound impact on how a company implements business processes and IT. An operating model has two dimensions which are (1) business process standardization and (2) integration: According to Ross, Weil and Robertson (2006), standardization of business processes can be defined as; \u201cdefining exactly how a process will be executed regardless of who is performing the process or where it is completed. Process standardization delivers efficiency and predictability across the company\u201d Business process standardization can lead to large increases in throughput and efficiency. However, it comes at a price since the more business processes are standardized, the more difficult it is to tailor services and products for specific customer needs hampering innovation and business agility in the process. Business process integration coordinates efforts and work across organizations through data. Sharing data can occur between processes to enable end-to-end transaction processing, or across processes to allow the company to present a single face to customers. Some benefits of integration are increased efficiency, coordination, transparency, and agility. However, integration entails a large amount of effort such as in end-to-end integration where companies need to develop standard data definitions and formats that will be shared and used across different business units and functions. Companies adopt an operating model at the enterprise level but could also adopt different operating models at the division, business region, or other level. In order to define an operating model at any of these different levels, companies need to answer the following two questions (Ross, Weil and Robertson (2006)): To what extent is the successful completion of one business unit\u2019s transactions dependent on the availability, accuracy, and timeliness of other business unit\u2019s data? To what extent does the company benefit by having business units run their operations in the same way? The first question determines integration requirements while the second one covers the standardization requirements of an organizations. Depending on these requirements, there are four different possible operating models as depicted in table~\\ref{tab:ekg-maturity-business-operating-model-quadrants}. \u200b \u200b Coordination Unification Business Process Integration High Shared customers, products or suppliers Customers or suppliers may be local or global Impact on other business unit transactions Globally integrated business processes often with support of enterprise systems Operationally unique business units or functions Business units with similar or overlapping responsibilities Autonomous business management Centralized management often applying functional/process/business unit matrix Business unit control over process design High level process owners design standardized processes Shared customer/supplier data Centrally mandated database Consensus process for design of IT infrastructure services IT decisions made centrally _ _ IT application decisions made in business units Low Diversification Replication Few if any shared customers or suppliers Few if any shared customers or suppliers Independent transactions Independent transactions are aggregated at high level Operationally unique business units Operationally similar business units Autonomous business management Autonomous business unit leaders with limited direction over processes Business unit control over process design Centralized control over business process design Few data standards across business units Standardized data definitions, but data locally owned with some aggregation at corporate level _ _ _ _ Most IT decisions made within business units Centrally mandated IT services Low High Business Process Standardization ~~ Figure 1: Operating Model Quadrant \u00a922005 MIT Sloan school of business Each one of these four operating model types is described below: Diversification : low standardization, low integration Coordination : low standardization, high integration Replication : high standardization, low integration Unification : high standardization, high integration","title":"Business Operating Model"},{"location":"article/operating-model/#diversification","text":"Diversification applies to companies that have different units with few common products, services, customers, or ways of doing business. Central management exerts relatively little control over business units that operate in a highly autonomous way offering their own products and services to their own customers. The Diversification model may offer synergies from related, but not integrated, business units. In this context, business units may create demand for one another or increase the company\u2019s brand recognition which creates enterprise-wide value. Although there could be some synergies between business units, the success of companies with a Diversification model stem from the success of the individual business units and acquisitions of other related businesses.","title":"Diversification"},{"location":"article/operating-model/#coordination","text":"Business units in a Coordination company usually share one of the following: customers, products, suppliers, and partners. Some benefits of the Coordination model are integrated customer service, cross-selling and transparency across supply chain processes. Whereas key business processes are tightly integrated, business units have unique processes and capabilities. In these companies, low cost is not the main driver as the main driver is delivering the best service and products to the customer while executing business processes in the most efficient way possible. Strong central management defines and prioritizes cooperation. Through integration without a high degree of standardization across business units or functions, growth can be achieved by offering already existing products or services to customer segments in new markets. Additionally, growth can also be achieved by improving services to meet new, but related, customer demands.","title":"Coordination"},{"location":"article/operating-model/#replication","text":"The Replication model provides autonomy to business units but runs operations in a highly standardized way. The business units are not tightly integrated as they are not dependent on each other\u2019s transactions while they implement a set of highly standardized business processes that can be easily repeated in new business units. McDonald\u2019s and other franchise companies are examples of a Replication company. The advantage of this model is that it enables organizations to build new business units from scratch with relatively little effort.","title":"Replication"},{"location":"article/operating-model/#unification","text":"Companies that operate as a highly optimized whole---around a highly standardized set of business processes---% may benefit from the Unification model. Business units in these companies may have relatively very little autonomy and they best maximize efficiencies and customer services by using integrated data and driving variability out of business processes. Unification companies typically have integrated supply chains with interdependencies between distributed business units. These business units share transaction data and standardized business processes. Therefore, these companies may benefit the most from enterprise-wide systems to support company standardization and integration requirements. Management in these companies is highly centralized and plays an important role in driving out inefficiencies to foster growth through economies of scale by introducing new products. Since variability must be minimized in these companies, this model is best suited for companies that compete on price such as those that offer commodities where innovation or customization are not key.","title":"Unification"},{"location":"article/operating-model/#applying-the-operating-model-to-attain-growth","text":"An operating model is the underlying logic of how an organization will enable and execute strategies. Each operating model entails its own opportunities for growth. The need to tightly integrate business processes make acquisitions and mergers---for both the buy-side as well as the sell-side---more challenging as disparate data definitions need to be reconciled. However, the tight process integration of the Coordination and Unification models offers opportunities of organic growth through expansion into new markets or extensions of current product lines. Process standardization, as in the Unification and Replication models, enables growth through a rip-an-replace approach to acquisitions. When an acquiring company wants to create a mirror image of itself out of an acquired company, it only has to replace the processes and systems of the acquired business with its own. However, both models do not offer much leverage when a company chooses to expand into operationally distinct lines of business as both models depend on leveraging already existing processes. The Diversification model imposes fewer constraints on the organic growth of individual business units and fewer limits for business acquisitions. However, it does not offer the benefits of integration and standardization across business units. The opportunities for growth of each operating model are shown in table~\\ref{tab:ekg-maturity-business-operating-model-different}. \u200b \u200b Coordination Unification Business Process Integration High Organic: stream of product innovations easily made available to existing customers using existing integrated channels. Organic: leverage economies of scale by introducing existing products/services in new markets; grow product line incrementally. _ _ Acquisition: can acquire new customers for existing products but must integrate data. Acquisition: can acquire competitors to leverage existing foundation; must rip and replace infrastructure. Low Diversification Replication Organic: small business units may feed core business; company grows through business unit growth Organic: replicate best practices in markets; innovations extended globally _ _ _ _ Acquisition: unlimited opportunities; must ensure shareholder value Acquisition: can acquire competitors to expand market reach; must rip and replace Low High Business Process Standardization ~~ Figure 2: Different operating models position companies for different types of growth \u00a92005 MIT Center for Information Systems Research Business units of a company can also adopt different operating models to respond to conflicting demands. For instance, Diversification companies may benefit from allowing their own business units to adopt their own operating models as these business units are highly independent. An example of a Diversification company whose business units adopted different operating models is Johnson & Johnson. J&J\u2019s U.S. pharmaceutical group applies a Coordination operating model in which there is a single touchpoint with health-care practitioners while their subsidiary Janssen Pharmaceuticals implements a Replication operating model in Europe with highly standardized, low cost processes. This gives freedom to each business unit to implement a different operating model depending on its own objectives while maintaining a relatively simple operating model at a corporate level.

The value proposition of EKG \u00b6 Companies face increasingly difficult challenges due to the complexity of their business environments stemming from market disruptions, new regulations, the COVID-19 pandemic or other large scale events. In such a challenging business world, being able to have a clear oversight of an organization as a whole has become more critical than ever to assess risk exposure, to find supply chain bottlenecks, to comply to regulations among other business requirements. Therefore, connecting the dots spread inside and outside each company is necessary for all these crucial tasks. In this context, the word dots refers to data needed to carry out these different tasks. However, connecting the dots is far easier said than done as these dots are most often spread across a myriad of business silos that may not even aware of each other\u2019s existence and in different formats that make the task of integrating and harmonizing data across the enterprise overly complex. As a solution to this problem, the Semantic Web and its underlying standards were developed as an answer to integrate, identify, catalogue, harmonize and assign meaning to individual pieces of data from different sources. Enterprise Knowledge Graphs (EKGs) aim at doing that at an enterprise-wide level by using Semantic Web standards and technologies. Additionally, EKGs can boost other technologies such as machine learning and blockchain by feeding them with high-quality and meaningful data. The purpose of this maturity model is to guide companies and other organizations throughout the development of Enterprise Knowledge Graphs as a tool to develop capabilities that they may consider vital for their own businesses such as risk management or customer 360\u00b0 and for which connecting the dots is necessary. Since this journey will certainly require lots of time and effort, this maturity model aims at providing a step-by-step rationale of how companies can develop EKGs that serve their own business needs. The maturity model will guide enterprises throughout its different maturity levels that will mark the progress of the Enterprise in developing EKG (s) for this kind of enterprise-wide use cases. In order to make the utility of Knowledge Graphs for enterprises clearer, this part will provide some examples of how knowledge graphs could be used to tackle the aforementioned problems and to connect the dots for some use cases. However, the decision of which use cases need to be supported and prioritized is up to each enterprise. Therefore, the following examples are just mere illustrations of what companies can do by connecting the dots. People using Amazon\u2019s Alexa, ordering food through Uber Eats or booking a listing on Airbnb are using a knowledge graph even if they are totally unaware of that. Amazon, Alexa, Uber among other cutting-edge companies have been using knowledge graph technology to disrupt entire sectors and to create new value propositions to their customers. 1 For example, Amazon uses a product graph to categorize products on its retail website and to make better product suggestions to customers among other things. 2 In that context, Knowledge Graphs fulfills the role of disruption enabler. In order to illustrate this, it will be discussed how Airbnb uses a knowledge graph to enhance its customer experience by integrating and conducting computer reasoning on data coming from different data sources. On the other hand, Enterprise Knowledge Graphs may also provide great value when being used to support the daily operations of a business and, in that context, the enterprise is their end user. Although there are fewer examples of knowledge graphs being used in this context, Deloitte\u2019s white papers discusses how knowledge graphs could be used in organizations to unravel the intricacies of their own business processes, relationships, supply chains, etc. by the means provided by Enterprise Knowledge Graphs as a business supporting/enabling technology. Customer experience enhancement at Airbnb \u00b6 In order to move towards its vision of becoming an end-to-end travel platform, Airbnb needs to be able to provide customers insights that help them decide when to travel, where to travel and what to do in their trips. For instance, Airbnb needs to be able to answer queries such as: What are the most popular landmarks and neighborhoods in London? Which Airbnb listings are best suited for working nomads? What are the most popular Italian restaurants in New York? Answering these queries may help travelers plan their trips much better and, in turn, Airbnb may increase its customer value proposition. As a means to answer all these customer queries, Airbnb uses a knowledge graph represented by the figure on the right. As explained by Chang (2018) 3 , semantic web knowledge graphs offer the ability of structuring and adding meaning to data from different sources such as relational databases in a scalable way to answer these queries. Additionally, it is far simpler to connect data about a certain object spread across different data sources with a knowledge graph than it is with a relational database. Another advantage of knowledge graphs compared to relational databases is that new relationships between concepts or objects can be added to a knowledge graph in a much more flexible and simpler fashion. For instance, knowledge graphs can link the concept surfing as a sport to the concept surfing which Hawaii is known for. So, if a customer asks Airbnb\u2019s website for surfing destinations , Hawaii may appear on the query results. This kind of associations might be far more difficult in a relational environment especially if the data about them come from different sources with different schemas. By connecting data about places, experiences, homes, restaurants, etc. as illustrated here, Airbnb is able to answer complicated user queries 4 such as What events, restaurants and homes are located in Mission District in San Francisco? as shown on the right and below.

Non-functional requirements \u00b6 The maturity model is therefore seen as the overall framework for all \"non-functional requirements\" (NFRs)---clustered per capability---that are not directly related to any given \"use case\". Use Case Tree \u00b6 For instance, if it is your company's strategy to be able to have real-time risk insights at all levels of your organization then we can separate the specific functional requirements of that very large use case from all the non-functional requirements that would come into place around your data management and governance practices, the state of your technology landscape, the culture of your organization and so forth. In this example, the use case Real-time risk management ---as the top-level strategic use case---would be broken down into various sub-use cases resulting in a so-called \" Use Case Tree \" (UCT). Each node in that tree represents some functionality---a capability so you will. How does this relate to the maturity model? Well, per use case in that tree structure you can determine how realistic it is to actually be able to implement that use case in relation to the level of maturity of the organization as a whole and more specifically in relation to any of the capabilities that are being covered in this document.

We're in the process of switching over to just generating this website instead which requires some minor changes in the process described here. Introduction \u00b6 The EKGF is a non-profit member-driven organization that unites parties in the EKG space to define best practice and matures the marketplace for EKG adoption, including: semantic standards to solve the challenges of data management a method for accelerated EKG deployment One of the activities of the EKGF is its work on the EKG maturity model ( EKG /Maturity ) which establishes standard criteria for measuring and guiding progress on EKG adoption through asking practical questions of different involved stakeholders. In order to be able to scale to a larger community of collaborating teams, each contributing content to the EKG /Maturity, we decided to \"eat our own dogfood\" and apply the same principles as we advocate for software development and data management such as \"work Agile\" and \"test everything\". The Process \u00b6 The collaboration process consists primarily of the following \"user stories\": As a critic , I want to be able to raise an issue As a workgroup member , I want to be able to plan issues As a fixer , I want to be able to fix issues As a reviewer , I want to be able to approve pull requests To summarize, we have 4 main things to do: Raise Plan Fix Approve An issue can be anything, your feedback, ideas, suggestions, spelling mistakes, inconsistencies, anything that should be changed on this website. Raise \u00b6 User Story As a critic , I want to be able to raise an issue Anyone who reads the produced content and has an issue with that content is a \"critic\". Each critic should be able to raise that issue formally with minimal effort. The audience of critics is hopefully very large, any reader of our content should be able to add their comments somewhere. We have to make it as easy as possible for them to do so. Unfortunately, the Issue Management function of GitHub repositories --- like the EKGF /ekg-maturity repository --- can only be used by people who have a GitHub account. As someone in the role of a critic, you don\u2019t have to deal with \"Agile\" or \"Kanban\". The various workgroups/teams will plan for (see Plan ) and process/fix (see Fix ) your issues. You can always see the status of your issue by clicking on it and checking the right side of the screen where you see links to the \"Assignee\" (the person who is going to work on your issue), the \"Project\" (the workgroup that\u2019s planning and tracking your issue) and the \"Linked pull requests\". How to register? \u00b6 We are asking every potential contributor, even someone who just wants to give us some feedback (a \"critic\") to join the EKGF as a private member (free) or as a corporate member. Email with registration@ekgf.org to set it up, if you plan to participate as a contributor to the EKG maturity model then please also supply your GitHub user-id. How to create a GitHub & Slack account? \u00b6 Slack \u00b6 If you already have a Slack account then join the EKGF workspace here: https://ekgf.slack.com/ . Otherwise, first create your Slack account here . GitHub \u00b6 Go to https://github.com/join . Since you can associate multiple email addresses to your GitHub account we would suggest to initially create it with your private email address which then becomes your \"primary email account\" in GitHub. You can add your business email address(es) to your GitHub account later. Mail your GitHub account id (user-id) to registration@ekgf.org so that we can add you to the access control list of the EKGF /ekg-maturity repository . How to raise an issue? \u00b6 While you\u2019re reading the website, you may have comments, we hope you do. Please raise as many \"issues\" as possible, any feedback is welcome. An issue can be a question, a suggestion, a grammar issue, an issue with the consistency of the story, anything that comes to mind. If you decide to let us benefit from your feedback then please follow these steps: Go to the main page where all issues are shown: https://github.com/ekgf/ekg-maturity/issues Check if your issue is already raised by someone else, if so, feel free to augment the discussion around that issue with your own concerns. If it clearly is a new issue, click the \"New Issue\" button . Give it a concise title and clear description and ideally: Copy paragraphs you don\u2019t agree with into the issue Copy the URL of the relevant page into the issue There is no need to specify values for any of the fields on the right side because the admin team will do that (but feel free to). Save by clicking the \u201cSubmit new issue\u201d button That\u2019s it. Thank you very much. Every issue is a discussion page, other people can respond to it and chip in. At some point, a workgroup will pick it up, assign it to their project board, plan for fixing it, etc. You will be notified of these changes automatically via GitHub email. Plan \u00b6 User Story As a planner , I want to be able to plan issues Work on the EKG maturity model is divided among workgroups that each take on one of [the four maturity model pillars] or horizontal slice of the maturity model. Workgroups are self-managed teams. The workgroups meet on a regular schedule. Any method that the team agrees to use to plan and to document issues during working sessions is ok. But, the official content of the maturity model is contained in the GitHub repository that is managed using the GitHub Kanban with review and automation process. Here are some useful links. Kanban - A brief introduction What is a Kanban Board? The idea is very simple though, we use the GitHub Projects facility. Currently, we have a project for each pillar and a general project. Here\u2019s the main page for EKG /Maturity GitHub Projects: https://github.com/ EKGF /ekg-maturity/projects What you see is a list of \"project boards\" where each project board is owned by a workgroup in the entire Kanban process. This begins with planning. The planning process consists of various tasks: Find open issues that are relevant to the workgroup in the list of issues: open issues that have not yet been assigned to a project board Link each issue that should be done by the workgroup to its corresponding project board. It will then appear at the bottom of the \u201cTo Do\u201d column of that board. Decide priority (see To Do Column ). Assign issues to members of the workgroup. By linking the issue to one or more assignees (open the issue by clicking on it and select the assignee at the top right corner) Follow the progress of issues as they go from left to right via the columns on the board. \"To Do\" Column \u00b6 As soon as an issue has been assigned to a given project, it will show up at the bottom of the To-Do Column. That To-Do Column can be seen as \"the backlog\" for that project (and for the workgroup that owns that project). Issues can be dragged and dropped within the To-Do Column. Issues at the top have the highest priority. Anyone in the workgroup can pick up issues assigned to them and start \"fixing\" them (which means resolving them), see Fix . \"In progress\" Column \u00b6 Pull Requests (PRs) and Issues 1 show up in this column automatically as soon as someone is actually working on the issue, see Fix . This means that as soon as a fixer \"pushes\" one or more \"commits\" to the GitHub repository that this will be seen as progress and show up accordingly on the project board. \"Review in progress\" Column \u00b6 Once the fixer has created their PR , they can ask for a review of the PR by selecting two or more reviewers. See Approve for information about how to do a review. \"Reviewer approved\" Column \u00b6 Once all reviewers have approved the PR , the last reviewer can then merge the PR into the main branch. By the way, a reviewer can also reject a change or ask for changes to be applied before approving the PR . The fixer then has to then apply new changes and commit them to the same branch and push those changes to GitHub. The PR page will then be updated automatically and a subsequent review process can then commence. As said above, once all approvals are given, the changes can then be merged by the final reviewer into the main branch which will trigger the final build workflow on GitHub creating a new version of the website you're looking at. \"Done\" Column \u00b6 When the merge of the PR is done the issue will move to the Done column. For each PR there is an underlying git branch which will be automatically deleted by GitHub once the PR has been merged into the main branch. Fix \u00b6 User Stories As a fixer , I want to be able to fix issues As a fixer , I want to be able to create a pull request The term \"fixer\" is our own term, they\u2019re usually called \"developer\" but we don\u2019t consider someone who works on EKG /Maturity content to be a developer necessarily. In the GitHub user interface, they show up as \"contributors\". Anyone who actually changes things in the repository will be registered by GitHub as a contributor to that repository 2 . There are several ways to change the content of the repository. There are roughly two methods though: Change content without making a clone of the repository by editing content on the GitHub site itself. Make a so-called git clone of the repository to your own workstation and use any appropriate editor to add or change things. Both methods require: \"creating a branch\" (See How to make a branch? ) \"committing a change\" (See How to commit a change? ) \"creating a pull request\" (See How to create a Pull Request? ) We will now describe how each of these three tasks can be done. How to start editing in GitHub? \u00b6 This is \"Method A\" as described above. First find the content file that you want to edit. All content is under the content root directory /docs . The arrow in the figure above shows the location of the \"edit button\" (ignore the other buttons). Click that button and change any content. All content is written in a \"language\" called Markdown which is a markup language for text content. Here's a Markdown \"cheat sheet\" as one page that shows everything you need to know about Markdown. Then it\u2019s time to save the changes, choose a good title for your change, and include the issue number (for instance #123 ) prefixed with a hash. This title is the so-called \"commit message\" and is described in more detail in How to commit a change? . How to make a branch? \u00b6 When editing straight on the GitHub site as described in the previous section, you have to save your work \"as a commit\" with a title that contains the issue number (which will be picked up by the project board). But you then also have to create a branch which shows up right under the title and description. Choose a branch name that explains what it is about. In some cases that would be all there is to it but in most cases you have multiple edits in multiple files for one given issue. So in those cases you would have to make sure to always refer to the right branch name where the branch name must include the issue number itself. For instance, for issue #123 the branch name would be issue-123 . How to commit a change? \u00b6 There are several ways to create a commit on a branch in a git repository. It\u2019s up to the \"fixer\" (usually called \"developer\" in most git documentation on the Internet) to decide which tooling they use. One way to do this is to just use the Github website itself but you could also create a so-called \"clone\" of the git repository on your local machine and use the standard git utility to create a commit or use an advanced editor like Visual Studio Code that has built-in git and Markdown support. It goes too far to document all the various different ways to do this in the context of this document. What\u2019s important to know is that, as a fixer, you should always include the issue number in the title of the commit. For example, if you edit a content page and then commit that change, you have to make sure that these two things are done before clicking the \"Propose Changes\" button as shown in the figure above. Use a title for your commit that includes the issue number, prefixed by # , for example, #123 for issue 123. Use a branch name that includes the issue number (no hash as a prefix). The #123 in the title will trigger GitHub to move the corresponding issue from the \"To Do\" column to the \"In Progress\" column. Do not use Fixed #123 or Close #123 because that will actually close the issue. Once you have done your first commit to a given branch, you\u2019re ready to create a PR . Many people wait with creating a PR until their last commit is pushed (one issue can involve many commits involving many files, but they all go to the same branch) but we recommend creating your PR as soon as possible, after the first commit, because that gives everyone an easier insight in the progress. Not everyone is up for that, \u201cexposing\u201d their first draft changes to others, but it\u2019s generally seen as good practice doing so. You can mark your PR as \u201cDraft\u201d via the GitHub user interface so that everyone knows that it is \u201cwork in progress\u201d. How to create a pull request? \u00b6 Assuming that you added some changes to a branch, in GitHub parlance: \"pushed some commits to a branch\", you can also create a PR . A PR can be seen as a \"request approval to change\"-form. It needs two branches: the branch that you want to change (that would usually be the main branch) and the branch that contains the new version with the proposed changes. GitHub automatically calculates the difference between those two branches and shows those differences on the PR -form. There are several places in the GitHub user interface where you can start creating a PR but the most basic one shows up at the branches page which shows all branches of the repository: https://github.com/ EKGF /ekg-maturity/branches On the right side of the table showing all the branches you either see an existing PR for the given branch or a button: It\u2019s easy from there. Give your PR a good title (that title goes into the \"changelog\" so be specific, although not to worry, it can be changed later) and a description and click the Create Pull Request button. Job done. A planner in the workgroup will take it from there, assign reviewers, link it to a project board etc. Approve \u00b6 User Story As a reviewer , I want to be able to approve pull requests TODO Issues are sometimes also called \u201cCards\u201d in Kanban terminology and in the Github project user interface.

Operating Model Performance Management Risk Management Supply Chain Management Scalability Assessment Capability Map Learn more Introduction & Background \u00b6 The modern economy is often characterized as an Information Economy or more specifically, Knowledge Economy, emphasizing the importance of knowledge as the key productivity lever and intellectual capital as the key differentiator of enterprises. Widespread digitalization over the last two decades has accelerated the scale, reach and impact of businesses in today\u2019s knowledge economy. Seven of the top ten firms globally by market capitalization at the time of this writing ( Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, Facebook, Tencent, Alibaba), are representative of this characterization. This underscores the broad expectation that future competitiveness is increasingly focused on embedding and capitalizing knowledge in the design, delivery and eventual effectiveness of products, services and activities in business models of Enterprises. What does a knowledge-based differentiated focus in products and services mean for enterprises? Prevalent characterization of some business models offers some clue: Embedded Finance The emphasis that convenience of financial products is increasingly determined by integrating them seamlessly into non-financial applications and processes. Embedded Finance offers a new, very large addressable market opportunity worth over $7 trillion in ten years' time, twice the combined value of the world\u2019s top 30 banks today. Subscription Services The emphasis that experience of products and services is increasingly determined not from broad contours of use over time but by specific contexts of use at any given time. 78% of international adults in 2021 have subscription services (71% in 2018). And 75% believe that in the future, people will subscribe to more services and own less physical \"stuff\". Platform Services The emphasis that utility of services is increasingly determined not from clarity of individual service but through convenience of search and similarity of use across a range of related products and services. More than 30% of global economic activity---some $60 trillion---could be mediated by digital platforms 2019---When we exceeded 1 billion Knowledge Workers ...Where we\u2019re going is a future of work with knowledge... being created at the pace only possible with one billion workers. What does empowering its knowledge workers and embedding knowledge in products and services mean for enterprises? In the following sections, we explore a few illustrative capabilities that enable enterprises to leverage and embed knowledge in their propositions, products and services, planning and activities. The Business Case for Explorative Execution \u00b6 Business performance emphasising financial performance---typically, aspects of revenue, profit, growth and risk. Mechanisms such as Balanced Scorecards to their business performance, emphasising the causal chains coursing through organizational capability, operations and customer propositions, eventually landing into financial performance as an outcome. More recently, there has been an emphasis on key stakeholder metrics such as ESG adding further dimensions to responsible business performance. The paradigm of business performance has largely hinged on organizations directly influencing their customer engagements with their products and services. Indeed, the prevalent use of the term \"customer\" is ingrained as a counterpart to the organizations\u2019 products. Dramatic advances in the digital economy, especially in the area of mobile and sensor technology over the last 15 years, have highlighted the perception of value through insights into consumption/use. In other words, the presumed value in organizations\u2019 products and services is increasingly validated through actual insights into consumption/use by consumers. This shift in perspective of an organizations\u2019 products and services as patterns (based on insights) of consumer use is where movements such as design thinking}, customer journey maps etc are increasingly considered as important tools for developing and validating propositions. The \"aha\" and \"viola\" moments from such exercises require further translation into realizing the propositions, which is where practices around agility, DevOps etc. are increasingly mainstream. All these themes and mechanisms of strategy execution through communication, product/service propositions, development/deployment and its performance management largely depend on a human capital based on participation, expertise and intuition. Organizations wishing to amplify their human capital face a few key dichotomies to be addressed: Customer vs Consumer Mindset and capability shift from \"Customer market share\" to \"share of (end) consumer value\" Enterprise vs Ecosystem Mindset and capability shift from \u201cProprietary control of customer experiences\u201d to \u201copen collaboration on consumer experiences\u201d Human Machine Continuum Mindset shift from human-scaled to machine-scaled (intelligent and autonomous) business capability Each of the above dichotomies highlights the limitations enterprises face today in extending business capability beyond their organizational boundaries, be it in sourcing information beyond their own channels or collaborating on shared experiences. Addressing these challenges requires enterprises to adopt an exploratory style in executing their strategy 1 which specifically focuses on sensing and understanding the consumer ecosystem better before taking decisions and acting (to be aligned to hyper-personalization, both in retail and business consumer scenarios) To put this \u201cExplorative Execution\u201d into perspective, a useful mental model is SUDA (Sense, Understand, Decide, Act, a slight variant of John Boyd\u2019s OODA loop), specifically focused on responding/acting in a dynamic evolving environment. The choice of the mental model is to bring out its contrast with the imperative style mental model of Plan, Do, Check, Act ( PDCA ), usually used for acting in an environment of more certainty and predictability. SENSE Accessing actual contents of need and use by consumers easily overwhelms most organizations for a variety of reasons, chief amongst which is the sheer volume of context-unique interactions which must be checked for links to an organization\u2019s business interests and intents. Most of this is practiced subjectively and accorded to human expertise and intuition. UNDERSTAND Unlike the carefully curated lens of its products and services, inputs of interest for an organization are generally ambiguous requiring significant efforts to disambiguate and synthesize. (John Boyd\u2019s Orientation isn\u2019t just a state you\u2019re in; it\u2019s a process. You\u2019re always orienting.) DECIDE Disambiguated information still isn\u2019t directly actionable as there is a significant element of hypothesis embedded within. This is especially challenging with high prevalence of conflicting hypotheses in many cases. ACT Filtered sensing, hypothesis-based understanding and scenario-driven decision-making finally create an actionable context, which the organizational operations can execute. A deeper analysis of the SUDA -loop of \u201cExplorative Execution\u201d brings into focus the following requirements of capability: Identity How can sensing be practiced in a subject domain of multiple identities?

What changes can be made to make products and services more relevant for (retail and business) consumers? Business Identity \u00b6 Business Identity is a statement of a company's unique innovation, service, and/or product based value proposition. A business identity , published to the world via business identifier unique Enterprise Knowledge Graphs, may transparently use a data infrastructure that can support many distinct business activities. An enterprise could have multiple Business Identities based on the value propositions underlying its products and services---it is imperative that each must be perceived (as having differentiators) and consumed (as unique offerings) by its customers and stakeholders. The Sense imperative is addressed by using the Business Identity as an \u201cattractor\u201d amidst the voluminous stream of interactions. This is especially important in a privacy conscious environment where interest in and intent of using information is clearly understood and agreed upon upfront. The Understand imperative is addressed by using the Business Identity as a common link between the complementary mechanisms of (a) fulfilment within an enterprise and (b) the collaboration contexts with the partners. The Decide imperative is addressed by using the Business Identity as an enterprise persona for scenario planning and evaluation --- rather than viewing an enterprise as a structural entity. Business Identity enables an ( EKG powered) enterprise to constantly assess and align its value propositions to a) the needs and use-contexts of consumers and b) the collaboration mechanisms with business partners for effective fulfilment.

A Business Identity can link brand statements such as the above with the wider contexts of an Enterprise\u2019s corporate values, vision etc and the specifics of the product/service features and integration with other products/services of the enterprise/wider ecosystem. Aligning Business Identity with Activities in an Enterprise \u00b6 Enterprises use a variety of mechanisms today to organize \u201cinventories\u201d of their activities. The artifacts take a variety of forms ranging from free-form documentation of manuals, data and process models along different methodologies to data records and programming repositories. Business Capability Models, Business Canvas, Business Reference Architectures etc have been some of the outputs used to serve as organization-wide references of activities. The objectives guiding such management are mostly around efficiency of categorizing, storing and retrieval, focused around \u201cwhat is done\u201d and \u201cwho does it\u201d. The key challenge in efficiency oriented approaches is that the perception can be quite subjective based on the needs of the departments or teams --- which leads to a variety of approaches across the length and breadth of any enterprise. There are several implications of using such a variety of approaches --- chief amongst which is the reconciliation effect expended every time a deviation has to be managed, exceptions have to be handled or a change introduced in any activity. Targeting efficiency of reconciliations through techniques such as focus-groups, standardization of documentation etc. is a typical response of most organizations. Taking the intuitive notion of a Business Identity (as a conceptual anchor for an organization\u2019s engagement with its stakeholders) forward, enterprises can benefit from using a simple, organization-wide concept anchor focused around \u201cwhy is it done\u201d for its activities. This anchor need not be prescriptive to change the way an organization manages its activities but descriptive to enhance the ability to more effectively leverage information within the artifacts. One candidate for such an intuitive anchor is the contract. In fact, a contract may initially take the form of a memorandum of understanding ( MOU ), an agreement outlined in a formal document that may later become a legal contract. If we take the Business Identity as a basis for viewing an organization\u2019s product and services, a contract can be seen as a specific engagement around which the activities of various departments and teams are organized. More specifically, a contract can be seen as a collection of related commitments, potentially spread over time, which provide the necessary context for any activity in an organization. Interestingly, while it's well-understood that a contract is a definitive source of specifics around any agreement with stakeholders, it's currently referred to only in the extreme case of legal recourse in handling disagreements. Another perception of contracts is that they do not cover all collaboration contexts which guide activities in an organization. Contracts have several features which help align the Business Identity with the activities within an enterprise --- and the wider ecosystem, for that matter. Together with the legal system and societal norms, contracts provide a contextual basis for belief/trust between an enterprise and its stakeholders in the ecosystem Contracts are specific to the parties involved and provide an ideal contextual basis for (hyper)personalisation of products and services --- through bounded simulation of contract performance Measures of performance in organizational activities, such as cost, operational efficiencies and innovation effectiveness can be aligned to contractual performance contexts We now look at two key elements of organizational activity (enabled by EKG ) aimed at orienting and realizing business strategy, through the lens of Business Identity and Contracts: Business Strategy Actuation is a business identity oriented process that senses, understands and communicates business outcome-based assessment data to focus energy and resources on strategic objectives. Actuation measurement values are used to assess whether strategic objectives and associated business goals are being fulfilled. Business Model Elaboration is the process of providing further detail of business strategy. It may include decision rationale that explains how the business identity data infrastructure and algorithms enable the how and why planned actions would create, deliver, and capture value. Business Enablers utilizes Business Identity to scope the EKG facts and facets that are needed to have a single source of truth about each of their Suppliers, Partners and Consumers. For example, when a Business Identity point to point relationship with the Identities of all their Customers is enabled, implementors have much greater clarity about what must be governed, collected, analyzed, and securely stored.

Widespread digitalization over the last two decades has accelerated the scale, reach and impact of businesses in today\u2019s knowledge economy. Seven of the top ten firms globally by market capitalization at the time of this writing ( Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, Facebook, Tencent, Alibaba), are representative of this characterization. This underscores the broad expectation that future competitiveness is increasingly focused on embedding and capitalizing knowledge in the design, delivery and eventual effectiveness of products, services and activities in business models of Enterprises. What does a knowledge-based differentiated focus in products and services mean for enterprises? Prevalent characterization of some business models offers some clue: Embedded Finance The emphasis that convenience of financial products is increasingly determined by integrating them seamlessly into non-financial applications and processes. Embedded Finance offers a new, very large addressable market opportunity worth over $7 trillion in ten years' time, twice the combined value of the world\u2019s top 30 banks today. Subscription Services The emphasis that experience of products and services is increasingly determined not from broad contours of use over time but by specific contexts of use at any given time. 78% of international adults in 2021 have subscription services (71% in 2018). And 75% believe that in the future, people will subscribe to more services and own less physical \"stuff\". Platform Services The emphasis that utility of services is increasingly determined not from clarity of individual service but through convenience of search and similarity of use across a range of related products and services.

Mechanisms such as Balanced Scorecards to their business performance, emphasising the causal chains coursing through organizational capability, operations and customer propositions, eventually landing into financial performance as an outcome. More recently, there has been an emphasis on key stakeholder metrics such as ESG adding further dimensions to responsible business performance. The paradigm of business performance has largely hinged on organizations directly influencing their customer engagements with their products and services. Indeed, the prevalent use of the term \"customer\" is ingrained as a counterpart to the organizations\u2019 products. Dramatic advances in the digital economy, especially in the area of mobile and sensor technology over the last 15 years, have highlighted the perception of value through insights into consumption/use. In other words, the presumed value in organizations\u2019 products and services is increasingly validated through actual insights into consumption/use by consumers. This shift in perspective of an organizations\u2019 products and services as patterns (based on insights) of consumer use is where movements such as design thinking}, customer journey maps etc are increasingly considered as important tools for developing and validating propositions. The \"aha\" and \"viola\" moments from such exercises require further translation into realizing the propositions, which is where practices around agility, DevOps etc. are increasingly mainstream. All these themes and mechanisms of strategy execution through communication, product/service propositions, development/deployment and its performance management largely depend on a human capital based on participation, expertise and intuition. Organizations wishing to amplify their human capital face a few key dichotomies to be addressed: Customer vs Consumer Mindset and capability shift from \"Customer market share\" to \"share of (end) consumer value\" Enterprise vs Ecosystem Mindset and capability shift from \u201cProprietary control of customer experiences\u201d to \u201copen collaboration on consumer experiences\u201d Human Machine Continuum Mindset shift from human-scaled to machine-scaled (intelligent and autonomous) business capability Each of the above dichotomies highlights the limitations enterprises face today in extending business capability beyond their organizational boundaries, be it in sourcing information beyond their own channels or collaborating on shared experiences. Addressing these challenges requires enterprises to adopt an exploratory style in executing their strategy 1 which specifically focuses on sensing and understanding the consumer ecosystem better before taking decisions and acting (to be aligned to hyper-personalization, both in retail and business consumer scenarios) To put this \u201cExplorative Execution\u201d into perspective, a useful mental model is SUDA (Sense, Understand, Decide, Act, a slight variant of John Boyd\u2019s OODA loop), specifically focused on responding/acting in a dynamic evolving environment. The choice of the mental model is to bring out its contrast with the imperative style mental model of Plan, Do, Check, Act ( PDCA ), usually used for acting in an environment of more certainty and predictability. SENSE Accessing actual contents of need and use by consumers easily overwhelms most organizations for a variety of reasons, chief amongst which is the sheer volume of context-unique interactions which must be checked for links to an organization\u2019s business interests and intents. Most of this is practiced subjectively and accorded to human expertise and intuition. UNDERSTAND Unlike the carefully curated lens of its products and services, inputs of interest for an organization are generally ambiguous requiring significant efforts to disambiguate and synthesize. (John Boyd\u2019s Orientation isn\u2019t just a state you\u2019re in; it\u2019s a process. You\u2019re always orienting.) DECIDE Disambiguated information still isn\u2019t directly actionable as there is a significant element of hypothesis embedded within. This is especially challenging with high prevalence of conflicting hypotheses in many cases.

Widespread digitalization over the last two decades has accelerated the scale, reach and impact of businesses in today\u2019s knowledge economy. Seven of the top ten firms globally by market capitalization at the time of this writing ( Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, Facebook, Tencent, Alibaba), are representative of this characterization. This underscores the broad expectation that future competitiveness is increasingly focused on embedding and capitalizing knowledge in the design, delivery and eventual effectiveness of products, services and activities in business models of Enterprises. What does a knowledge-based differentiated focus in products and services mean for enterprises? Prevalent characterization of some business models offers some clue: Embedded Finance The emphasis that convenience of financial products is increasingly determined by integrating them seamlessly into non-financial applications and processes. Embedded Finance offers a new, very large addressable market opportunity worth over $7 trillion in ten years' time, twice the combined value of the world\u2019s top 30 banks today. Subscription Services The emphasis that experience of products and services is increasingly determined not from broad contours of use over time but by specific contexts of use at any given time. 78% of international adults in 2021 have subscription services (71% in 2018). And 75% believe that in the future, people will subscribe to more services and own less physical \"stuff\". Platform Services The emphasis that utility of services is increasingly determined not from clarity of individual service but through convenience of search and similarity of use across a range of related products and services. More than 30% of global economic activity---some $60 trillion---could be mediated by digital platforms 2019---When we exceeded 1 billion Knowledge Workers ...Where we\u2019re going is a future of work with knowledge... being created at the pace only possible with one billion workers.

Mechanisms such as Balanced Scorecards to their business performance, emphasising the causal chains coursing through organizational capability, operations and customer propositions, eventually landing into financial performance as an outcome. More recently, there has been an emphasis on key stakeholder metrics such as ESG adding further dimensions to responsible business performance. The paradigm of business performance has largely hinged on organizations directly influencing their customer engagements with their products and services. Indeed, the prevalent use of the term \"customer\" is ingrained as a counterpart to the organizations\u2019 products. Dramatic advances in the digital economy, especially in the area of mobile and sensor technology over the last 15 years, have highlighted the perception of value through insights into consumption/use. In other words, the presumed value in organizations\u2019 products and services is increasingly validated through actual insights into consumption/use by consumers. This shift in perspective of an organizations\u2019 products and services as patterns (based on insights) of consumer use is where movements such as design thinking}, customer journey maps etc are increasingly considered as important tools for developing and validating propositions. The \"aha\" and \"viola\" moments from such exercises require further translation into realizing the propositions, which is where practices around agility, DevOps etc. are increasingly mainstream. All these themes and mechanisms of strategy execution through communication, product/service propositions, development/deployment and its performance management largely depend on a human capital based on participation, expertise and intuition. Organizations wishing to amplify their human capital face a few key dichotomies to be addressed: Customer vs Consumer Mindset and capability shift from \"Customer market share\" to \"share of (end) consumer value\" Enterprise vs Ecosystem Mindset and capability shift from \u201cProprietary control of customer experiences\u201d to \u201copen collaboration on consumer experiences\u201d Human Machine Continuum Mindset shift from human-scaled to machine-scaled (intelligent and autonomous) business capability Each of the above dichotomies highlights the limitations enterprises face today in extending business capability beyond their organizational boundaries, be it in sourcing information beyond their own channels or collaborating on shared experiences. Addressing these challenges requires enterprises to adopt an exploratory style in executing their strategy 1 which specifically focuses on sensing and understanding the consumer ecosystem better before taking decisions and acting (to be aligned to hyper-personalization, both in retail and business consumer scenarios) To put this \u201cExplorative Execution\u201d into perspective, a useful mental model is SUDA (Sense, Understand, Decide, Act, a slight variant of John Boyd\u2019s OODA loop), specifically focused on responding/acting in a dynamic evolving environment. The choice of the mental model is to bring out its contrast with the imperative style mental model of Plan, Do, Check, Act ( PDCA ), usually used for acting in an environment of more certainty and predictability. SENSE Accessing actual contents of need and use by consumers easily overwhelms most organizations for a variety of reasons, chief amongst which is the sheer volume of context-unique interactions which must be checked for links to an organization\u2019s business interests and intents. Most of this is practiced subjectively and accorded to human expertise and intuition. UNDERSTAND Unlike the carefully curated lens of its products and services, inputs of interest for an organization are generally ambiguous requiring significant efforts to disambiguate and synthesize. (John Boyd\u2019s Orientation isn\u2019t just a state you\u2019re in; it\u2019s a process. You\u2019re always orienting.) DECIDE Disambiguated information still isn\u2019t directly actionable as there is a significant element of hypothesis embedded within. This is especially challenging with high prevalence of conflicting hypotheses in many cases. ACT Filtered sensing, hypothesis-based understanding and scenario-driven decision-making finally create an actionable context, which the organizational operations can execute. A deeper analysis of the SUDA -loop of \u201cExplorative Execution\u201d brings into focus the following requirements of capability: Identity How can sensing be practiced in a subject domain of multiple identities? How can a shift from form-based to a function-based identity be enabled? Self-describing How can understanding be practiced in a subject domain with multiple descriptions? How can a shift from structure-based description to a behavior-based description be enabled? Open world ambiguity How can decision-making be practiced in scenarios which require constant revalidation and conflict resolution, as new facts become known? An EKG is a key organizational capability to enable Explorative Execution using a SUDA mental model , through the following core features: SENSE Co-existence of multiple identifications based on context and interpretation instead of the prevalent content based identification How do retail consumers and business consumers use products and services? UNDERSTAND Emphasis on meaning through association rather than static descriptions Enhanced collaboration with ecosystem partners through standards on context sharing rather than lengthy negotiations on content specifics How do the products and services address needs of consumers? DECIDE Significant scale in knowledge driven operations through autonomous reasoning Leverage of existing (diverse and federated) content sources instead of separate curated content repositories How can products and services add more value through effective use? What changes can be made to make products and services more relevant for (retail and business) consumers?","title":"The Business Case for Explorative Execution"},{"location":"pillar/business/background-and-intro/#business-identity","text":"Business Identity is a statement of a company's unique innovation, service, and/or product based value proposition. A business identity , published to the world via business identifier unique Enterprise Knowledge Graphs, may transparently use a data infrastructure that can support many distinct business activities. An enterprise could have multiple Business Identities based on the value propositions underlying its products and services---it is imperative that each must be perceived (as having differentiators) and consumed (as unique offerings) by its customers and stakeholders. The Sense imperative is addressed by using the Business Identity as an \u201cattractor\u201d amidst the voluminous stream of interactions. This is especially important in a privacy conscious environment where interest in and intent of using information is clearly understood and agreed upon upfront. The Understand imperative is addressed by using the Business Identity as a common link between the complementary mechanisms of (a) fulfilment within an enterprise and (b) the collaboration contexts with the partners. The Decide imperative is addressed by using the Business Identity as an enterprise persona for scenario planning and evaluation --- rather than viewing an enterprise as a structural entity. Business Identity enables an ( EKG powered) enterprise to constantly assess and align its value propositions to a) the needs and use-contexts of consumers and b) the collaboration mechanisms with business partners for effective fulfilment. Examples of prominent brand statements : Apple Watch It\u2019s the ultimate device for a healthy life. Apple Watch can do what your other devices can't because it's on your wrist.

Netflix is a subscription-based streaming service that allows our members to watch TV shows and movies without commercials on an internet-connected device.

The artifacts take a variety of forms ranging from free-form documentation of manuals, data and process models along different methodologies to data records and programming repositories. Business Capability Models, Business Canvas, Business Reference Architectures etc have been some of the outputs used to serve as organization-wide references of activities. The objectives guiding such management are mostly around efficiency of categorizing, storing and retrieval, focused around \u201cwhat is done\u201d and \u201cwho does it\u201d. The key challenge in efficiency oriented approaches is that the perception can be quite subjective based on the needs of the departments or teams --- which leads to a variety of approaches across the length and breadth of any enterprise. There are several implications of using such a variety of approaches --- chief amongst which is the reconciliation effect expended every time a deviation has to be managed, exceptions have to be handled or a change introduced in any activity. Targeting efficiency of reconciliations through techniques such as focus-groups, standardization of documentation etc. is a typical response of most organizations. Taking the intuitive notion of a Business Identity (as a conceptual anchor for an organization\u2019s engagement with its stakeholders) forward, enterprises can benefit from using a simple, organization-wide concept anchor focused around \u201cwhy is it done\u201d for its activities. This anchor need not be prescriptive to change the way an organization manages its activities but descriptive to enhance the ability to more effectively leverage information within the artifacts. One candidate for such an intuitive anchor is the contract. In fact, a contract may initially take the form of a memorandum of understanding ( MOU ), an agreement outlined in a formal document that may later become a legal contract. If we take the Business Identity as a basis for viewing an organization\u2019s product and services, a contract can be seen as a specific engagement around which the activities of various departments and teams are organized. More specifically, a contract can be seen as a collection of related commitments, potentially spread over time, which provide the necessary context for any activity in an organization. Interestingly, while it's well-understood that a contract is a definitive source of specifics around any agreement with stakeholders, it's currently referred to only in the extreme case of legal recourse in handling disagreements. Another perception of contracts is that they do not cover all collaboration contexts which guide activities in an organization. Contracts have several features which help align the Business Identity with the activities within an enterprise --- and the wider ecosystem, for that matter. Together with the legal system and societal norms, contracts provide a contextual basis for belief/trust between an enterprise and its stakeholders in the ecosystem Contracts are specific to the parties involved and provide an ideal contextual basis for (hyper)personalisation of products and services --- through bounded simulation of contract performance Measures of performance in organizational activities, such as cost, operational efficiencies and innovation effectiveness can be aligned to contractual performance contexts We now look at two key elements of organizational activity (enabled by EKG ) aimed at orienting and realizing business strategy, through the lens of Business Identity and Contracts: Business Strategy Actuation is a business identity oriented process that senses, understands and communicates business outcome-based assessment data to focus energy and resources on strategic objectives. Actuation measurement values are used to assess whether strategic objectives and associated business goals are being fulfilled. Business Model Elaboration is the process of providing further detail of business strategy. It may include decision rationale that explains how the business identity data infrastructure and algorithms enable the how and why planned actions would create, deliver, and capture value. Business Enablers utilizes Business Identity to scope the EKG facts and facets that are needed to have a single source of truth about each of their Suppliers, Partners and Consumers.

Defining what a business does and which outcomes it wants to achieve. Understanding what a business does is at least as important as understanding how it does it. Focusing on the what rather than on the how often provides the right level of abstraction of complex ecosystems in a way that can be easily digested by business executives and planning teams. In recent years, the word capability has steadily been drawing attention in the business world as a way to narrow the gap between business and IT. A capability is described by Ulrich and Rosen, (p.1, 2011) as: A business capability, or simply a \u201ccapability,\u201d defines what a business does. It does not communicate or expose where, why, or how something is done---only what is done. Specifically, the business capability is \u201ca particular ability or capacity that a business may possess or exchange to achieve a specific purpose or outcome. Understanding what a business does is at least as important as understanding how it does it. Focusing on the what rather than on the how often provides the right level of abstraction of complex ecosystems in a way that can be easily digested by business executives and planning teams. Dissecting a business as a set of basic capabilities allows one to view complex organizations and business environments in a wide range of different ways. Additionally, one could zoom in on lower levels of abstraction to reach higher levels of detail depending on the needs of the target audience. Consider the example of the high-level capability called customer 360\u00b0 . This capability refers to having a complete picture of the customer and this is a capability many organizations may benefit from. A customer may be called a taxpayer in the context of a government institution, a patient in the context of a hospital and a student in the context of a university. Being able to manage different aspects of a customer might be imperative for many businesses depending on their business strategy. For instance, customer 360\u00b0 as a high-level capability could entail the customer trend analysis and customer management information capabilities as lower-level capabilities. In other words, this means that capabilities are concerns that could be refined into lower-level capabilities that in turn could be further refined. The advantage of functional decomposition in this hierarchical and modular way is that it increases the reusability of capabilities across business lines, enterprises or even industries. Additionally, decomposing capabilities in different levels of abstraction offers a better sense of how capabilities fit in on the overall view of the enterprise. Capabilities should follow certain principles as follows: Capabilities define what a business does and not how a business does it. This implies that a capability does not refer to a process or value stream. Capabilities are nouns, not verbs. To make the distinction between a capability and a process, capabilities should be named with nouns such as customer management instead of a verb managing customers. Capabilities should be defined in business term and not in technical terms. Executives and other business professionals should be able to clearly understand what a capability means ---and take ownership of it---without being bothered with the technical details of the systems that implement it. Capabilities should be stable (i.e. least volatile) as possible. There is a fundamental set of high-level capabilities that are necessary to run a business regardless of the sector of industry it is located in. Additionally, high-level capabilities may rarely change within an organization unless there are significant changes to its business strategy or organization. Capabilities are not redundant. Capabilities appear once and only once on a capability maps even though they are shared by more than division, business line or business unit of an enterprise. There should only be one business capability map per business. In order to bring transparency across the organization, there should be a single unified and harmonized business capability map per business. Therefore, business capabilities spread throughout different business units, divisions, department, lines of business, etc should be only appear once in the business capability map. Capabilities map to---but are not the same as---business processes, business units, Lines of Business (LOBs) and value streams. There is rarely a one-to-one mapping between a business process, a business unit, an LOB or a value stream, and a capability. Therefore, mistaking a capability with one these other concepts may result in an overly complex overview of things that are constantly repeated across the enterprise. Additionally, we\u2019re trying to understand the what rather than the how and this would not be possible if capabilities are mistaken with process-related concepts. Automated capabilities are still business capabilities and not IT capabilities. Capabilities are owned by the business as they are made by and for the business. Therefore, a capability that has been automated with an IT system is not an IT capability. Instead, it is nothing else than an automated business capability . Capabilities are the most valuable when incorporated in the overall pictures of a business\u2019 ecosystem. While being useful in a stand-alone basis for discussion and planning, capabilities fulfil their biggest potential by being combined into a larger business capability map that represents the business ecosystem of an enterprise. Dimensions \u00b6 Warn Work in progress, this is just the results of an initial brainstorm session, needs to be worked out Capability Map Coverage: does your capability map cover your whole business? Scale of 0-100% Is your capability map represented in the EKG itself and if so, what\u2019s the coverage? Scale 0-100% Is your Capability Map an executable model (and is it actually executed)?

Notes: the who, what, when and how is more important for the other pillars Do you understand the value of each capability How does each capability fit in the business mission/vision/strategy Did you identify the what of each business capability? Scale 1 to 5. Notes: the who, what, when and how is more important for the other pillars Here is how the maturity levels of developing a capability map with an Enterprise Knowledge Graph ( EKG ) might progress: EKG initiation : At this stage, the organization has just begun using an EKG to develop a capability map. The EKG may be used to store and manage data on the organization's capabilities, but it is not yet fully integrated into the organization's processes and systems. Extensible platform : At this stage, the organization has made significant progress in integrating the EKG into its processes and systems, and is using it to manage and update the capability map on an ongoing basis. The EKG has become an important tool for storing and organizing data on the organization's capabilities, and is being used to inform decision-making and strategic planning. Enterprise ready : At this stage, the EKG is a fully integrated and essential part of the organization's operations. It is being used to manage and update the capability map in real-time, and is providing valuable insights and information to help the organization make informed decisions. Strategic asset : At this stage, the EKG is seen as a strategic asset by the organization, and is being used to drive innovation and competitive advantage. It is being used to identify new opportunities and areas for growth, and to develop strategies to build and strengthen the organization's capabilities. Operational ecosystem : At this final stage, the EKG has become a key part of the organization's operational ecosystem, seamlessly integrating with other systems and processes to support the organization's operations and decision-making. The capability map is an integral part of this ecosystem, providing a clear and comprehensive view of the organization's capabilities and how they align with its goals and objectives. Levels \u00b6 Warn Work in progress Contribution to the EKG \u00b6 The Business Capability Map enables an enterprise to structure their Enterprise Knowledge Graph. Each capability is a candidate to become a use case for the EKG . A well-designed mature EKG is a facade in front of all technical and organizational silos which means that---without any further structure---users do not experience the negative effects of these silos anymore. In many ways that may be a good thing but having silos---or different perspectives---can also be necessary. The EKG allows an organization to rethink their silos without being held back by their current data or technology landscape (or \"technical debt\"). The Business Capability Map is the ideal initial structure for the new EKG \"silos\". Business Capability Maps are usually rather coarse-grained and visualized in a three-level hierarchy whereas the structure of the EKG goes much further than that. Translating each capability to a use case is a good start but each of these use cases can be further broken down into smaller use cases where each use case becomes a highly reusable component of the EKG . This leads to a hierarchical structure---a taxonomy so you will---of all use cases, also called \"the Use Case Tree\" (UCT). This use case tree, at the higher levels, corresponds with the Business Capability Map and allows a business and its executives to \"own\" and control all the various parts of their EKG . Contribution to the Enterprise \u00b6 As a business/IT transformation enabler, capabilities may provide certain benefits to enterprises: Capabilities provide business with a common language. Capabilities offer business professionals and C-level executives a common understanding of which areas of an enterprise they need to address. The larger the enterprise, the more useful this idea is since business issues and strategy may revolve around many business units, lines of business, business processes, or even enterprise boundaries. Capabilities may enable more precise investments. Measuring the ROI of investment projects can be very difficult as the results might be spread across a myriad of different LOBs or business units. Instead of reconciling results from all these different places, one could merely look at the resources being allocated at a certain capability and this may allow business executives to have better estimates of the impact of their investments on the enterprise as a whole . Capabilities serve as a baseline for strategic planning, change management and impact analysis. By shifting the focus from business units, lines of business, IT systems and business processes to business capabilities, one is able to increase the traceability of strategic decisions into the daily operations and the business performance of the enterprise as a whole . So, capabilities serve as a starting point for tracking the impact horizontal and vertical impacts of strategic and tactical decisions from the executive team. Capabilities lead to better business service specification and design. Capabilities provide business-focused abstraction of the functionalities and information that information systems must provide. For instance, such capabilities may help in the selection or construction of services in a SOA as they directly embody business requirements. In a few words, capabilities provide business executives the possibility to cut through the complexity inherent to most enterprises in order to make sounder decisions for strategic planning, impact analysis and investment planning. Using capabilities enables business to make decisions based on what needs to be resolved without initially dealing with the how . At the same time, it provides a way to tie the how to the results of the _what_for further validation that business efforts are delivery the expected results and for better alignment. On the other hand, the alternative to this approach involves repeating the traditional silo-focused approach of looking at hundreds or even thousands of IT systems, before being able to look at actual business actions and business results. Without an Enterprise Knowledge Graph ( EKG ), the development of a capability map would likely involve manually gathering data on the capabilities that are important to your organization. This could involve reviewing internal documents, conducting market research, and seeking input from experts within the organization. Once the data has been collected, you would need to manually organize and structure it in a way that allows you to create a visual representation of your organization's capabilities. This could be in the form of a diagram, chart, or other visual tool. Without the EKG , you would also need to find a way to store and manage the data that you have collected. This could involve creating and maintaining manual records, or using a separate database or spreadsheet tool. Finally, you would need to find a way to link the capabilities on the map to related information and resources, such as training materials, best practices, and case studies. This could involve manually searching for and compiling this information, or relying on other tools or systems to help you access and organize it. Overall, the development of a capability map without an EKG would likely be more time-consuming and labor-intensive, as it would involve manually gathering and organizing data, and finding ways to access and link related information and resources. Moreover, certain capabilities may not be able to be implemented with other technologies but EKG . Warn Work in progress, describe how this capability is possibly being delivered today in a non- EKG context and optionally what the issues are that EKG could or should improve A capability map is a visual representation of the capabilities of an organization or business unit. It is typically used to identify areas of strength and areas that need improvement, and can be used to guide strategic planning and decision-making. To develop a capability map with an Enterprise Knowledge Graph ( EKG ), you would first need to identify the capabilities that are important to your organization. Next, you would need to gather data on these capabilities. This could include data on the current state of each capability, as well as information on trends and changes over time. This data could come from a variety of sources, including internal documents, market research, and external experts. Once you have collected this data, you can use it to create a visual representation of your organization's capabilities. This could be in the form of a diagram, chart, or other visual tool. The EKG can then be used to store and manage this data, allowing you to easily access and update the capability map as needed. The EKG can also be used to link the capabilities on the map to related information and resources, such as training materials, best practices, and case studies. This can help to provide context and depth to the map, and can help to identify opportunities for growth and improvement. Finally, the EKG could also be used to implement such capabilities and even to implement strategic capabilities such as Customer 360\u00b0. Warn Work in progress, describe how this capability would be delivered or supported using an EKG approach, making the link to the \"how\" i.e. the EKG /Method . There are several potential use cases for a capability map, including: Identifying strengths and weaknesses : A capability map can help an organization identify its areas of strength and weakness, allowing it to focus on areas where it excels and identify opportunities for improvement in areas where it may be lacking. Strategic planning : A capability map can be used to inform strategic planning and decision-making by providing a clear understanding of the organization's current capabilities and how they align with its goals and objectives. Resource allocation : A capability map can help an organization allocate resources more effectively by identifying areas where additional investment may be needed to build or strengthen capabilities. Talent management : A capability map can be used to identify gaps in an organization's talent and to develop strategies for attracting and retaining employees with the necessary skills and expertise. Collaboration and coordination : A capability map can help an organization understand the capabilities of other business units or departments, facilitating collaboration and coordination across the organization. Communication : A capability map can be used to communicate the capabilities of an organization to stakeholders, including customers, partners, and investors. Change management : A capability map can help an organization understand the impacts of changes to its business model, processes, or systems, and identify any necessary changes to its capabilities in response. Mergers and acquisitions : A capability map can be used to identify overlaps and gaps in capabilities between two organizations during the due diligence process of a merger or acquisition. Innovation : A capability map can help an organization identify areas where it has the necessary capabilities to pursue new opportunities or ideas, or where it may need to build new capabilities in order to innovate. Benchmarking : A capability map can be used to compare the capabilities of an organization to those of its competitors or peers, allowing it to identify areas where it may have an advantage or disadvantage. Risk assessment : A capability map can help an organization identify areas where it may be vulnerable due to a lack of capabilities, and develop strategies to mitigate these risks. Customer relationship management : A capability map can be used to understand the capabilities that are important to customers, and to identify areas where the organization can differentiate itself from its competitors.

There is a fundamental set of high-level capabilities that are necessary to run a business regardless of the sector of industry it is located in. Additionally, high-level capabilities may rarely change within an organization unless there are significant changes to its business strategy or organization. Capabilities are not redundant. Capabilities appear once and only once on a capability maps even though they are shared by more than division, business line or business unit of an enterprise. There should only be one business capability map per business. In order to bring transparency across the organization, there should be a single unified and harmonized business capability map per business. Therefore, business capabilities spread throughout different business units, divisions, department, lines of business, etc should be only appear once in the business capability map. Capabilities map to---but are not the same as---business processes, business units, Lines of Business (LOBs) and value streams. There is rarely a one-to-one mapping between a business process, a business unit, an LOB or a value stream, and a capability. Therefore, mistaking a capability with one these other concepts may result in an overly complex overview of things that are constantly repeated across the enterprise. Additionally, we\u2019re trying to understand the what rather than the how and this would not be possible if capabilities are mistaken with process-related concepts. Automated capabilities are still business capabilities and not IT capabilities. Capabilities are owned by the business as they are made by and for the business. Therefore, a capability that has been automated with an IT system is not an IT capability. Instead, it is nothing else than an automated business capability . Capabilities are the most valuable when incorporated in the overall pictures of a business\u2019 ecosystem. While being useful in a stand-alone basis for discussion and planning, capabilities fulfil their biggest potential by being combined into a larger business capability map that represents the business ecosystem of an enterprise.","title":"A.3.6.

Notes: the who, what, when and how is more important for the other pillars Here is how the maturity levels of developing a capability map with an Enterprise Knowledge Graph ( EKG ) might progress: EKG initiation : At this stage, the organization has just begun using an EKG to develop a capability map. The EKG may be used to store and manage data on the organization's capabilities, but it is not yet fully integrated into the organization's processes and systems. Extensible platform : At this stage, the organization has made significant progress in integrating the EKG into its processes and systems, and is using it to manage and update the capability map on an ongoing basis. The EKG has become an important tool for storing and organizing data on the organization's capabilities, and is being used to inform decision-making and strategic planning. Enterprise ready : At this stage, the EKG is a fully integrated and essential part of the organization's operations. It is being used to manage and update the capability map in real-time, and is providing valuable insights and information to help the organization make informed decisions. Strategic asset : At this stage, the EKG is seen as a strategic asset by the organization, and is being used to drive innovation and competitive advantage. It is being used to identify new opportunities and areas for growth, and to develop strategies to build and strengthen the organization's capabilities. Operational ecosystem : At this final stage, the EKG has become a key part of the organization's operational ecosystem, seamlessly integrating with other systems and processes to support the organization's operations and decision-making. The capability map is an integral part of this ecosystem, providing a clear and comprehensive view of the organization's capabilities and how they align with its goals and objectives.","title":"Dimensions"},{"location":"pillar/business/business-enablers/capability-map/#levels","text":"Warn Work in progress","title":"Levels"},{"location":"pillar/business/business-enablers/capability-map/#contribution-to-the-ekg","text":"The Business Capability Map enables an enterprise to structure their Enterprise Knowledge Graph. Each capability is a candidate to become a use case for the EKG . A well-designed mature EKG is a facade in front of all technical and organizational silos which means that---without any further structure---users do not experience the negative effects of these silos anymore. In many ways that may be a good thing but having silos---or different perspectives---can also be necessary. The EKG allows an organization to rethink their silos without being held back by their current data or technology landscape (or \"technical debt\"). The Business Capability Map is the ideal initial structure for the new EKG \"silos\". Business Capability Maps are usually rather coarse-grained and visualized in a three-level hierarchy whereas the structure of the EKG goes much further than that. Translating each capability to a use case is a good start but each of these use cases can be further broken down into smaller use cases where each use case becomes a highly reusable component of the EKG . This leads to a hierarchical structure---a taxonomy so you will---of all use cases, also called \"the Use Case Tree\" (UCT). This use case tree, at the higher levels, corresponds with the Business Capability Map and allows a business and its executives to \"own\" and control all the various parts of their EKG .","title":"Contribution to the EKG"},{"location":"pillar/business/business-enablers/capability-map/#contribution-to-the-enterprise","text":"As a business/IT transformation enabler, capabilities may provide certain benefits to enterprises: Capabilities provide business with a common language. Capabilities offer business professionals and C-level executives a common understanding of which areas of an enterprise they need to address. The larger the enterprise, the more useful this idea is since business issues and strategy may revolve around many business units, lines of business, business processes, or even enterprise boundaries. Capabilities may enable more precise investments. Measuring the ROI of investment projects can be very difficult as the results might be spread across a myriad of different LOBs or business units. Instead of reconciling results from all these different places, one could merely look at the resources being allocated at a certain capability and this may allow business executives to have better estimates of the impact of their investments on the enterprise as a whole . Capabilities serve as a baseline for strategic planning, change management and impact analysis. By shifting the focus from business units, lines of business, IT systems and business processes to business capabilities, one is able to increase the traceability of strategic decisions into the daily operations and the business performance of the enterprise as a whole . So, capabilities serve as a starting point for tracking the impact horizontal and vertical impacts of strategic and tactical decisions from the executive team. Capabilities lead to better business service specification and design. Capabilities provide business-focused abstraction of the functionalities and information that information systems must provide. For instance, such capabilities may help in the selection or construction of services in a SOA as they directly embody business requirements. In a few words, capabilities provide business executives the possibility to cut through the complexity inherent to most enterprises in order to make sounder decisions for strategic planning, impact analysis and investment planning. Using capabilities enables business to make decisions based on what needs to be resolved without initially dealing with the how . At the same time, it provides a way to tie the how to the results of the _what_for further validation that business efforts are delivery the expected results and for better alignment. On the other hand, the alternative to this approach involves repeating the traditional silo-focused approach of looking at hundreds or even thousands of IT systems, before being able to look at actual business actions and business results. Without an Enterprise Knowledge Graph ( EKG ), the development of a capability map would likely involve manually gathering data on the capabilities that are important to your organization. This could involve reviewing internal documents, conducting market research, and seeking input from experts within the organization. Once the data has been collected, you would need to manually organize and structure it in a way that allows you to create a visual representation of your organization's capabilities. This could be in the form of a diagram, chart, or other visual tool. Without the EKG , you would also need to find a way to store and manage the data that you have collected. This could involve creating and maintaining manual records, or using a separate database or spreadsheet tool. Finally, you would need to find a way to link the capabilities on the map to related information and resources, such as training materials, best practices, and case studies. This could involve manually searching for and compiling this information, or relying on other tools or systems to help you access and organize it. Overall, the development of a capability map without an EKG would likely be more time-consuming and labor-intensive, as it would involve manually gathering and organizing data, and finding ways to access and link related information and resources. Moreover, certain capabilities may not be able to be implemented with other technologies but EKG . Warn Work in progress, describe how this capability is possibly being delivered today in a non- EKG context and optionally what the issues are that EKG could or should improve A capability map is a visual representation of the capabilities of an organization or business unit. It is typically used to identify areas of strength and areas that need improvement, and can be used to guide strategic planning and decision-making. To develop a capability map with an Enterprise Knowledge Graph ( EKG ), you would first need to identify the capabilities that are important to your organization. Next, you would need to gather data on these capabilities. This could include data on the current state of each capability, as well as information on trends and changes over time. This data could come from a variety of sources, including internal documents, market research, and external experts. Once you have collected this data, you can use it to create a visual representation of your organization's capabilities. This could be in the form of a diagram, chart, or other visual tool. The EKG can then be used to store and manage this data, allowing you to easily access and update the capability map as needed. The EKG can also be used to link the capabilities on the map to related information and resources, such as training materials, best practices, and case studies. This can help to provide context and depth to the map, and can help to identify opportunities for growth and improvement. Finally, the EKG could also be used to implement such capabilities and even to implement strategic capabilities such as Customer 360\u00b0. Warn Work in progress, describe how this capability would be delivered or supported using an EKG approach, making the link to the \"how\" i.e. the EKG /Method . There are several potential use cases for a capability map, including: Identifying strengths and weaknesses : A capability map can help an organization identify its areas of strength and weakness, allowing it to focus on areas where it excels and identify opportunities for improvement in areas where it may be lacking. Strategic planning : A capability map can be used to inform strategic planning and decision-making by providing a clear understanding of the organization's current capabilities and how they align with its goals and objectives. Resource allocation : A capability map can help an organization allocate resources more effectively by identifying areas where additional investment may be needed to build or strengthen capabilities. Talent management : A capability map can be used to identify gaps in an organization's talent and to develop strategies for attracting and retaining employees with the necessary skills and expertise. Collaboration and coordination : A capability map can help an organization understand the capabilities of other business units or departments, facilitating collaboration and coordination across the organization. Communication : A capability map can be used to communicate the capabilities of an organization to stakeholders, including customers, partners, and investors. Change management : A capability map can help an organization understand the impacts of changes to its business model, processes, or systems, and identify any necessary changes to its capabilities in response. Mergers and acquisitions : A capability map can be used to identify overlaps and gaps in capabilities between two organizations during the due diligence process of a merger or acquisition. Innovation : A capability map can help an organization identify areas where it has the necessary capabilities to pursue new opportunities or ideas, or where it may need to build new capabilities in order to innovate. Benchmarking : A capability map can be used to compare the capabilities of an organization to those of its competitors or peers, allowing it to identify areas where it may have an advantage or disadvantage. Risk assessment : A capability map can help an organization identify areas where it may be vulnerable due to a lack of capabilities, and develop strategies to mitigate these risks. Customer relationship management : A capability map can be used to understand the capabilities that are important to customers, and to identify areas where the organization can differentiate itself from its competitors.

The desired level of business process integration & standardization. Operating Models 1 are the foundations of execution, in support of an enterprise's strategy. Enterprises use operating models to organize and coordinate their activities in order to most effectively engage with their customers and business partners. At its simplest, an Operating Model enables an Enterprise to realise its vision and strategy at the level of everyday execution --- business operations. An operating model --- or lack of it --- has a profound impact on how a company implements its business processes and organizes supporting technologies. Depending on an enterprise's Business Models, multiple operating models, at corporate and unit/divisional levels, could co-exist, in pursuit of the business strategy. In order to define an operating model at any of these different levels, Enterprises need to answer the following two questions: To what extent is the successful completion of one business unit\u2019s operations/transactions dependent on the availability, accuracy, and timeliness of other business unit\u2019s information? To what extent does the enterprise benefit by having business units run their operations in the same way? The first question determines integration requirements while the second one covers the standardization requirements of an Enterprise. Note 80% of CEOs in one study claim to have transformations in place to make their businesses more digital; 87% expect to see a change in their operating models within three years. In today's modern dynamic economic environment, Enterprises have to contend with a variety of choices in the selection, ongoing evaluation and transformation of their operating models. Such choices are necessitated by a fast-changing competitive landscape and the accompanying need to constantly align the workforce capacity and capabilities to business tactics. Typical triggers of consideration include comparative metrics such as higher-than-peer Cost-to-Income Ratios in key product portfolios, costs per transaction, Net Promoter Score/CSI, time-to-market for new products et al. While practices around specifics of Operating Models vary across Enterprises, we highlight below a few key focus areas in the setup and transformation of their operating models and in such a context, how EKGs can act as effective enablers: Integration \u00b6 Effective coordination across silos of activities with disjoint goals in any given external interaction (customer or stakeholder) In the Introductory section, we have introduced the idea of using Contracts as an intuitive anchor for coordinating activities in an enterprise, towards its engagements with customers and stakeholders. An Operating Model can leverage the context of \"why\" and \"what\" in the contracts and specify the \"who\" and \"how\" to align and link various activities within a business unit, across business units and across enterprise boundaries. Many enterprises are using the concept of \"User/Customer Journeys\" to align and link cross unit activities in their Operating Models --- such User/Customer Journeys can be considered to be instance models of Contract execution, enabling Enterprises to assess and select appropriate features in their Operating Models. Standardization \u00b6 Trade-offs between Individual Efficiency and Overall Effectiveness in the business processes A key challenge many enterprises face is in the choice between improving efficiencies focused on individual business processes and effectiveness of the overall end-to-end business flow. In the introductory section, we have introduced the idea of using Business Identities as intuitive anchor for an Enterprise\u2019s engagement with its stakeholders. To address the trade-off challenge on individual vs collective efficiency in its business processes, an Enterprise\u2019s Business Identity can help in (a) aligning the guidance of the enterprise's vision/mission/values to the trade-off and (b) ensuring consistency in practices and tools, through standardization, in the execution of business processes.

Assessing scalability (work in progress). TODO Business scalability assessment \u00b6 What is business scalability? \u00b6 Business scalability refers to a company's ability to grow and handle increased demand for its products or services without being hindered by its internal processes and systems. In other words, a scalable business is one that can easily adapt to changes in demand and continue to operate efficiently and effectively, regardless of how quickly the business is growing. This is often achieved through a combination of factors such as having a solid business plan, using efficient and flexible systems and technologies, and having a team of employees who are able to adapt to new challenges. By having a scalable business, a company can more easily expand its operations and increase its profits over time. What is business scalability assessment? \u00b6 A business scalability assessment is a process through which a company evaluates its ability to handle growth and increase in demand for its products or services. This typically involves examining various aspects of the business, such as its internal processes and systems, its market position, and its overall financial health. The goal of a business scalability assessment is to identify any potential bottlenecks or constraints that could hinder the company's ability to grow and adapt to changing market conditions, and to develop strategies for addressing these issues. This can help a company ensure that it is well-positioned to take advantage of opportunities for growth and to avoid potential pitfalls that could hamper its ability to scale up its operations. The dimensions of business scalability assessment can vary depending on the specific needs and goals of the organization.

Explain how EKG contributes value and how this capability or capability- enables higher levels of maturity for the EKG (which in turn provides more value to the business) A business scalability assessment is a process of evaluating an organization's ability to grow and adapt to changing market conditions, customer preferences, and competitive pressures. Without an enterprise knowledge graph, the scalability assessment would typically involve a lot of manual effort, data gathering, and analysis, and it would be difficult to maintain and update the assessment as the organization evolves. Without an enterprise knowledge graph, the scalability assessment would typically involve the following steps: Identify the objectives and criteria of the assessment : The first step would be to identify the goals and objectives of the scalability assessment, as well as the criteria and metrics that will be used to evaluate the organization's scalability. This would typically involve interviews and discussions with key stakeholders, as well as a review of relevant documents and data sources. Collect and organize data : The next step would be to collect and organize the data and information needed to conduct the scalability assessment. This would typically involve manually gathering data from various sources, such as internal databases, external sources, and interviews with subject matter experts. Analyze and classify the data : The next step would be to analyze and classify the data, to identify the key drivers and barriers to scalability for the organization. This would typically involve manual analysis and classification, using techniques such as benchmarking, modeling, and simulation. Conduct the scalability assessment : The next step would be to conduct the actual scalability assessment, using the criteria and metrics identified in the previous step. This would typically involve manually evaluating the data and information collected and analyzed in previous steps, and comparing it to industry benchmarks and best practices. Review and refine the assessment : The final step would be to review and refine the scalability assessment, based on feedback from stakeholders and further analysis. This would typically involve iterative cycles of review, refinement, and validation, to ensure that the assessment accurately reflects the organization's scalability and potential for growth. Without an enterprise knowledge graph, the scalability assessment would be a time-consuming and labor-intensive process, with limited flexibility and scalability. It would be difficult to maintain and update the assessment as the organization evolves, and it would be challenging to use the assessment to drive decision-making and strategic planning. Warn Work in progress, describe how this capability is possibly being delivered today How can EKG enable composable business? \u00b6 An enterprise knowledge graph ( EKG ) can boost reuse, replicable modularity, and speed in several ways. First, by providing a single, unified view of an organization's data, an EKG can help businesses to identify and leverage data that can be used in multiple contexts, allowing them to quickly and easily combine different pieces of information to create new insights and solutions. This can facilitate the reuse of data across different parts of the organization, helping to reduce duplication of effort and to improve efficiency. Second, an EKG can also help businesses to more easily replicate and modularize their data and processes. By providing a standard way to connect and access data, an EKG can enable businesses to quickly and easily set up new operations in new locations or markets, and to combine different components and modules to create new products and services. This can help businesses to adapt to changing market conditions and to respond to increased demand for their products or services, allowing them to scale up their operations more easily and effectively. Finally, an EKG can also enable businesses to operate more quickly and efficiently. By providing a framework for organizing and analyzing data, an EKG can help businesses to access the information they need to make strategic decisions more quickly and easily. This can help businesses to respond to changing market conditions and to take advantage of new opportunities for growth and expansion, supporting their efforts to become more composable and scalable. How could EKG help organizations obtain economies of scale? \u00b6 An enterprise knowledge graph can provide economies of scale by enabling businesses to more efficiently and effectively manage their data and processes. By providing a single, unified view of an organization's data, a knowledge graph can help businesses to identify and leverage data that can be used in multiple contexts, reducing duplication of effort and improving efficiency. In addition, a knowledge graph can also help businesses to automate and streamline their internal processes, allowing them to reduce the amount of time and resources required to complete tasks. This can help businesses to scale up their operations more easily and effectively, allowing them to take advantage of opportunities for growth and expansion. Ultimately, by providing economies of scale, an enterprise knowledge graph can help businesses to become more profitable and sustainable over the long term. How can EKG enable business scalability assessment? \u00b6 An enterprise knowledge graph can help organizations with business scalability assessment by providing a framework for organizing and analyzing data, and by enabling businesses to quickly and easily access the information they need to make strategic decisions. By connecting and organizing data from multiple sources, a knowledge graph can provide a comprehensive view of an organization's operations, allowing businesses to identify potential bottlenecks or constraints that could hinder their ability to grow and adapt to changing market conditions. This can help businesses to develop strategies for addressing these issues and to improve their overall scalability. In addition, a knowledge graph can also provide businesses with insights into their market position, competitors, and potential opportunities for growth, helping them to make more informed decisions about their future direction and expansion plans. An enterprise knowledge graph ( EKG ) can help overcome some of the drawbacks of the traditional approach for business scalability assessment by providing a centralized, accessible repository of information about the organization and its capabilities. This can help teams and individuals within the organization quickly and easily access the data and information they need to assess the organization's scalability, reducing the time and resources required for the assessment. Additionally, the EKG can provide a more objective, data-driven approach to assessing the organization's scalability. By providing detailed, accurate, and up-to-date information about the organization's capabilities, market conditions, and financial performance, the EKG can help teams and individuals make more informed and objective assessments of the organization's scalability. This can help the organization more accurately and effectively evaluate its scalability, and can support more effective decision-making and resource allocation. Finally, the EKG can help the organization continuously monitor and assess its scalability over time. By providing real-time, up-to-date information about the organization's capabilities and performance, the EKG can help teams and individuals within the organization stay informed about changes and developments that may affect the organization's scalability. This can help the organization more effectively respond to changes in the market and its own capabilities, and can support ongoing efforts to improve and expand its scalability. How would business scalability assessment look like with EKG ? \u00b6 With an enterprise knowledge graph, the scalability assessment would be a more efficient and effective process, with greater flexibility and scalability. An enterprise knowledge graph is a centralized, interconnected, and dynamic representation of an organization's knowledge, and it can be used to capture, organize, and access data and information from multiple sources and formats. With an enterprise knowledge graph, the scalability assessment would typically involve the following steps: Identify the objectives and criteria of the assessment : The first step would be to identify the goals and objectives of the scalability assessment, as well as the criteria and metrics that will be used to evaluate the organization's scalability. This would typically involve defining the relevant entities, attributes, and relationships in the knowledge graph, using a standardized ontology and schema. Collect and integrate data : The next step would be to collect and integrate the data and information needed to conduct the scalability assessment. This would typically involve using the knowledge graph as a central platform for accessing and integrating data from multiple sources, such as internal databases, external sources, and interviews with subject matter experts. Analyze and classify the data : The next step would be to analyze and classify the data, to identify the key drivers and barriers to scalability for the organization. This would typically involve using the knowledge graph as a basis for applying advanced analytics and machine learning algorithms, to automatically classify and cluster the data, and identify patterns and trends. Conduct the scalability assessment : The next step would be to conduct the actual scalability assessment, using the criteria and metrics identified in the previous step. This would typically involve using the knowledge graph as a source of data and information, and using visualization tools and libraries to automatically generate the assessment, based on pre-defined templates and criteria. Review and refine the assessment : The final step would be to review and refine the scalability assessment, based on feedback from stakeholders and further analysis. This would typically involve using the knowledge graph as a platform for collaboration, feedback, and validation, to ensure that the assessment accurately reflects the organization's scalability and potential for growth. With an enterprise knowledge graph, the scalability assessment would be a more efficient, effective, and dynamic process, with greater flexibility and scalability. It would be easier to maintain and update the assessment as the organization evolves, and it would be more powerful and useful in driving decision-making and strategic planning.

Explain how EKG contributes value and how this capability or capability- enables higher levels of maturity for the EKG (which in turn provides more value to the business) A business scalability assessment is a process of evaluating an organization's ability to grow and adapt to changing market conditions, customer preferences, and competitive pressures. Without an enterprise knowledge graph, the scalability assessment would typically involve a lot of manual effort, data gathering, and analysis, and it would be difficult to maintain and update the assessment as the organization evolves. Without an enterprise knowledge graph, the scalability assessment would typically involve the following steps: Identify the objectives and criteria of the assessment : The first step would be to identify the goals and objectives of the scalability assessment, as well as the criteria and metrics that will be used to evaluate the organization's scalability. This would typically involve interviews and discussions with key stakeholders, as well as a review of relevant documents and data sources. Collect and organize data : The next step would be to collect and organize the data and information needed to conduct the scalability assessment. This would typically involve manually gathering data from various sources, such as internal databases, external sources, and interviews with subject matter experts. Analyze and classify the data : The next step would be to analyze and classify the data, to identify the key drivers and barriers to scalability for the organization. This would typically involve manual analysis and classification, using techniques such as benchmarking, modeling, and simulation. Conduct the scalability assessment : The next step would be to conduct the actual scalability assessment, using the criteria and metrics identified in the previous step. This would typically involve manually evaluating the data and information collected and analyzed in previous steps, and comparing it to industry benchmarks and best practices. Review and refine the assessment : The final step would be to review and refine the scalability assessment, based on feedback from stakeholders and further analysis. This would typically involve iterative cycles of review, refinement, and validation, to ensure that the assessment accurately reflects the organization's scalability and potential for growth. Without an enterprise knowledge graph, the scalability assessment would be a time-consuming and labor-intensive process, with limited flexibility and scalability.

Many such individuals might represent the same real world object. data value strings, numbers, dates which represent the data. property a type of data point that may be associated with individuals.

In the other direction, from ontology to vocabulary, it should be possible to generate a business glossary directly from ontologies for a given scope. Since they should capture the meaning of concepts applicable to an organization, or an even broader ecosystem, the choice of concepts to include in an EKG should be driven by business use cases. And different overlapping ontologies may be included and mapped to cover different relevant aspects. Likewise, it should be possible to generate---and map to---models for more conventional tools from ontologies, by applying technology-specific rules. Semantic modeling also eliminates the problem of hard-coding assumptions about the world into a single data model.

Different types of external data models are not needed in EKG but can be mapped to or generated. In fact, physical data modelers are a community with their own vocabulary.

Having the models themselves be resources that can be looked up means that all data is self-defining and carries its meaning with it.

Build versus buy decisions. Warn Work in progress Within an Enterprise Knowledge Graph there is a need to map and combine data using ontologies as a basis for the integration of classes/concepts to achieve wisdom through common view(s) & model(s). Partners will need to exchange information within N-lines of business and N-shared activities. Data integration must support these activities to connect data silos. Each lines of business can interchange data with concepts from ontologies for shared activities and transactions. External data can also be interchanged with the enterprise using similar concepts from ontologies with vendors, channels, and customers. Enterprise Knowledge Graphs when most mature fully implement a unity of heterogeneous sources. An evolving ontology drives data, information, knowledge, wisdom, and in turn is formed in that order. Graphs provide an operational structure to allow for chaining and integrating data to create information/data integration via linking data throughout. RDF graphs are serializable by materialized data represented in the form of triples and/or quads. Direct import queries enables data to be integrated into and within a knowledge graph. Extract, transform, load processes are necessary. Often these processes are abbreviated as ETL or ELT since the mapping/transform may occur once after a load process is performed. RDF mapping language, RML, is a generalized source mapping language for RDF to facilitate data integration from non- RDF sources. Examples of RML sources include JSON,CSV, TSV, XML. R2RML is a subset of RML, designed for integration of data from relational sources leveraging JDBC. CoNLL is a standard within NLP, Natural Language Processing, implemented in CSV/TSV. CoNLL can be stored using the expressiveness of RDF using CoNLL- RDF and converted back to CSV/TSV. Data when materialized should be stored in various RDF file serialization formats such as: RDF /XML, JSON-LD, Turtle/TTL, NQUADS, NTriples, TriG, Trix, and n3. The tools used in the ETL/ELT process should support manipulating data in these common standardized knowledge graph formats. ETL/ELT needs to orchestrated once of any scale with data pipelines and scheduling software.The simplest example would be using scheduling software with batch scripts, more elaborate open source examples would be using a Dev/MLOps framework. The goal of the ETL/ELT is to take RDF serialized data and incorporate into a knowledge graph RDF data store from serialized files. RDF data stores offer significant capabilities and performance over flat-file serialized files. At the most mature level of a knowledge graph data integration must incorporate mapping using utilities and/or capabilities using RDF mapping languages and subsets, RDF serializable files, and RDF data stores using ETL/ELT data pipelines.

Warn Work in progress What is key to operations? \u00b6 Knowing that the EKG team will more than likely be hands off from production, and even non production environments due to Sarbanes-Oxley makes day-to-day infrastructure management very challenging. In a regulated environment, software installations and hardware will be intentionally deployed by other Information Technology, IT, teams and drive their configuration and support. Infrastructure as code, which can be stored in source control, software allow teams to use markup such as YAML to manage configurations and orchestrate installation. A couple examples of open source software in this space include Ansible, Terraform, and Pulumi. EKG teams should try to leverage this to mitigate IT missteps that can and do occur while delegating the administration of the platform to other groups. Regardless of having the ability to treat infrastructure as code. It\u2019s imperative for the team to have access to an environment where they have privileges to run some of the infrastructure configuration manually and explore, as they may need to provide guidance to other IT teams such as a sandbox and/or lab. A sandbox is very useful to test and validate infrastructure in advance. Sandboxes, which could include a group of virtual machine instances in a lab should be as flexible as possible, and interim ideally. That said, because of the flexibility they offer there could be a tendency for them to become more permanent because of less restrictions. IT support groups will need very concise but relevant documentation to perform tasks, a step by step runbook. The sandboxes in the lab are viable way to create runbook documentation. Runbooks typically have specific configuration information, how to start and stopping software services, necessary permissions, troubleshooting tips, and other relevant server host information. Separate environments are typically defined and adhered to such as Development, User Acceptance Testing Production, Disaster Recovery, defined by IT. If you are doing machine learning, natural language processing, or anything which requires models , it may be imperative to have Production model training/development. This may seem counter intuitive to have a model training/development, but needed but may be challenging to justify as test data may not be representative due to redaction. Backups should be made both by disk image snapshots of the VMs, and serialized data exports from the software platform tools and utilities. Containerization, such as Docker, and container management, such as Kubernetes and Helm roles/playbooks, while pervasive may not be available. When not available numerous tool package managers such as pip, asdf, npm, brew, chocolatey, nixos, yum, apt are responsible for dependencies for underlying software components inevitably can fill the the gap but must be inventoried, understood, and dealt separately rather than just using as an opaque container provided. Package management can be categorized into operating system level, programming library, and application installation dependencies. This package management is often a time consuming, interwoven, tedious process, which should not to be under estimated for. Package managers can also be invoked from containers and infrastructure as code. \u2028 Typically in-house developed applications deployments are a push vs a pull, due to security requirements. Thus a DevOps pipeline incorporate Build from code, Archive artifacts, Scan for security issues, and Deploy to target server steps. A challenge is that custom applications use many libraries and packages, the application may expect to pull dependencies dynamically even at run time, in practice this may not be feasible on an air-gapped platform. Dependencies may need to be incorporated prior at build time and archived, and not dynamically at run-time depending on IT regulation and governance. When we are discussing operations, while important to the EKG team we typically are not discussing specific EKG roles of the platform with IT such as ontology versions. That said, we can discuss in terms they may understand such as ETL/ELT, data model management, and application performance vendor or developed in-house. It may be good to try to map terms the EKG is familiar with to IT terminology. Not everything can be mapped to IT terminology and but imperative. For example.Ensuring ontology namespace IRIs are allocated by DNS . An organization may have a preference for .net versus .com for example. That said, an ontologist may have no preference, unless it doesn\u2019t change. Any sort of artifact that expires such as certificates even DNS name allocations, should be managed by IT operations. These sort of infrastructure challenges may not even be visible or be on the agenda of the EKG team, but if not considered could cause outages while trying to rectify and determining responsibility. Folders need to be organized where data is staged and materialized, not in a haphazard manner, if IT has standards - follow them. Credentials should to be encrypted by a separate group and never given to a development team, if only for a temporary basis for troubleshooting and immediately changed after. You must have a dedicated IT support team to the EKG group, with appropriate access to perform administrative tasks, not necessarily root/admin access but with just the right amount of access to perform application management and/or operating system level changes if and only if the platform requires it. Release notes, platform, and other operational guidance should be published for the team to communicate with IT.

Operating Model Performance Management Risk Management Supply Chain Management Scalability Assessment Capability Map Learn more Introduction & Background \u00b6 The modern economy is often characterized as an Information Economy or more specifically, Knowledge Economy, emphasizing the importance of knowledge as the key productivity lever and intellectual capital as the key differentiator of enterprises. Widespread digitalization over the last two decades has accelerated the scale, reach and impact of businesses in today\u2019s knowledge economy. Seven of the top ten firms globally by market capitalization at the time of this writing ( Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, Facebook, Tencent, Alibaba), are representative of this characterization. This underscores the broad expectation that future competitiveness is increasingly focused on embedding and capitalizing knowledge in the design, delivery and eventual effectiveness of products, services and activities in business models of Enterprises. What does a knowledge-based differentiated focus in products and services mean for enterprises? Prevalent characterization of some business models offers some clue: Embedded Finance The emphasis that convenience of financial products is increasingly determined by integrating them seamlessly into non-financial applications and processes. Embedded Finance offers a new, very large addressable market opportunity worth over $7 trillion in ten years' time, twice the combined value of the world\u2019s top 30 banks today. Subscription Services The emphasis that experience of products and services is increasingly determined not from broad contours of use over time but by specific contexts of use at any given time. 78% of international adults in 2021 have subscription services (71% in 2018). And 75% believe that in the future, people will subscribe to more services and own less physical \"stuff\". Platform Services The emphasis that utility of services is increasingly determined not from clarity of individual service but through convenience of search and similarity of use across a range of related products and services. More than 30% of global economic activity---some $60 trillion---could be mediated by digital platforms 2019---When we exceeded 1 billion Knowledge Workers ...Where we\u2019re going is a future of work with knowledge... being created at the pace only possible with one billion workers. What does empowering its knowledge workers and embedding knowledge in products and services mean for enterprises? In the following sections, we explore a few illustrative capabilities that enable enterprises to leverage and embed knowledge in their propositions, products and services, planning and activities. The Business Case for Explorative Execution \u00b6 Business performance emphasising financial performance---typically, aspects of revenue, profit, growth and risk. Mechanisms such as Balanced Scorecards to their business performance, emphasising the causal chains coursing through organizational capability, operations and customer propositions, eventually landing into financial performance as an outcome. More recently, there has been an emphasis on key stakeholder metrics such as ESG adding further dimensions to responsible business performance. The paradigm of business performance has largely hinged on organizations directly influencing their customer engagements with their products and services. Indeed, the prevalent use of the term \"customer\" is ingrained as a counterpart to the organizations\u2019 products. Dramatic advances in the digital economy, especially in the area of mobile and sensor technology over the last 15 years, have highlighted the perception of value through insights into consumption/use. In other words, the presumed value in organizations\u2019 products and services is increasingly validated through actual insights into consumption/use by consumers. This shift in perspective of an organizations\u2019 products and services as patterns (based on insights) of consumer use is where movements such as design thinking}, customer journey maps etc are increasingly considered as important tools for developing and validating propositions. The \"aha\" and \"viola\" moments from such exercises require further translation into realizing the propositions, which is where practices around agility, DevOps etc. are increasingly mainstream. All these themes and mechanisms of strategy execution through communication, product/service propositions, development/deployment and its performance management largely depend on a human capital based on participation, expertise and intuition. Organizations wishing to amplify their human capital face a few key dichotomies to be addressed: Customer vs Consumer Mindset and capability shift from \"Customer market share\" to \"share of (end) consumer value\" Enterprise vs Ecosystem Mindset and capability shift from \u201cProprietary control of customer experiences\u201d to \u201copen collaboration on consumer experiences\u201d Human Machine Continuum Mindset shift from human-scaled to machine-scaled (intelligent and autonomous) business capability Each of the above dichotomies highlights the limitations enterprises face today in extending business capability beyond their organizational boundaries, be it in sourcing information beyond their own channels or collaborating on shared experiences. Addressing these challenges requires enterprises to adopt an exploratory style in executing their strategy 1 which specifically focuses on sensing and understanding the consumer ecosystem better before taking decisions and acting (to be aligned to hyper-personalization, both in retail and business consumer scenarios) To put this \u201cExplorative Execution\u201d into perspective, a useful mental model is SUDA (Sense, Understand, Decide, Act, a slight variant of John Boyd\u2019s OODA loop), specifically focused on responding/acting in a dynamic evolving environment. The choice of the mental model is to bring out its contrast with the imperative style mental model of Plan, Do, Check, Act ( PDCA ), usually used for acting in an environment of more certainty and predictability. SENSE Accessing actual contents of need and use by consumers easily overwhelms most organizations for a variety of reasons, chief amongst which is the sheer volume of context-unique interactions which must be checked for links to an organization\u2019s business interests and intents. Most of this is practiced subjectively and accorded to human expertise and intuition. UNDERSTAND Unlike the carefully curated lens of its products and services, inputs of interest for an organization are generally ambiguous requiring significant efforts to disambiguate and synthesize. (John Boyd\u2019s Orientation isn\u2019t just a state you\u2019re in; it\u2019s a process. You\u2019re always orienting.) DECIDE Disambiguated information still isn\u2019t directly actionable as there is a significant element of hypothesis embedded within. This is especially challenging with high prevalence of conflicting hypotheses in many cases. ACT Filtered sensing, hypothesis-based understanding and scenario-driven decision-making finally create an actionable context, which the organizational operations can execute. A deeper analysis of the SUDA -loop of \u201cExplorative Execution\u201d brings into focus the following requirements of capability: Identity How can sensing be practiced in a subject domain of multiple identities? How can a shift from form-based to a function-based identity be enabled? Self-describing How can understanding be practiced in a subject domain with multiple descriptions? How can a shift from structure-based description to a behavior-based description be enabled? Open world ambiguity How can decision-making be practiced in scenarios which require constant revalidation and conflict resolution, as new facts become known? An EKG is a key organizational capability to enable Explorative Execution using a SUDA mental model , through the following core features: SENSE Co-existence of multiple identifications based on context and interpretation instead of the prevalent content based identification How do retail consumers and business consumers use products and services? UNDERSTAND Emphasis on meaning through association rather than static descriptions Enhanced collaboration with ecosystem partners through standards on context sharing rather than lengthy negotiations on content specifics How do the products and services address needs of consumers? DECIDE Significant scale in knowledge driven operations through autonomous reasoning Leverage of existing (diverse and federated) content sources instead of separate curated content repositories How can products and services add more value through effective use? What changes can be made to make products and services more relevant for (retail and business) consumers? Business Identity \u00b6 Business Identity is a statement of a company's unique innovation, service, and/or product based value proposition. A business identity , published to the world via business identifier unique Enterprise Knowledge Graphs, may transparently use a data infrastructure that can support many distinct business activities. An enterprise could have multiple Business Identities based on the value propositions underlying its products and services---it is imperative that each must be perceived (as having differentiators) and consumed (as unique offerings) by its customers and stakeholders. The Sense imperative is addressed by using the Business Identity as an \u201cattractor\u201d amidst the voluminous stream of interactions. This is especially important in a privacy conscious environment where interest in and intent of using information is clearly understood and agreed upon upfront. The Understand imperative is addressed by using the Business Identity as a common link between the complementary mechanisms of (a) fulfilment within an enterprise and (b) the collaboration contexts with the partners. The Decide imperative is addressed by using the Business Identity as an enterprise persona for scenario planning and evaluation --- rather than viewing an enterprise as a structural entity. Business Identity enables an ( EKG powered) enterprise to constantly assess and align its value propositions to a) the needs and use-contexts of consumers and b) the collaboration mechanisms with business partners for effective fulfilment. Examples of prominent brand statements : Apple Watch It\u2019s the ultimate device for a healthy life. Apple Watch can do what your other devices can't because it's on your wrist. When you wear it, you get a fitness partner that measures all the ways you move, meaningful health insights, and a connection to the people and things you care about most. And it's always just a glance away. Netflix Unlimited films, TV programmes and more. Watch anywhere. Cancel at any time. Netflix is a subscription-based streaming service that allows our members to watch TV shows and movies without commercials on an internet-connected device. A Business Identity can link brand statements such as the above with the wider contexts of an Enterprise\u2019s corporate values, vision etc and the specifics of the product/service features and integration with other products/services of the enterprise/wider ecosystem. Aligning Business Identity with Activities in an Enterprise \u00b6 Enterprises use a variety of mechanisms today to organize \u201cinventories\u201d of their activities. The artifacts take a variety of forms ranging from free-form documentation of manuals, data and process models along different methodologies to data records and programming repositories. Business Capability Models, Business Canvas, Business Reference Architectures etc have been some of the outputs used to serve as organization-wide references of activities. The objectives guiding such management are mostly around efficiency of categorizing, storing and retrieval, focused around \u201cwhat is done\u201d and \u201cwho does it\u201d. The key challenge in efficiency oriented approaches is that the perception can be quite subjective based on the needs of the departments or teams --- which leads to a variety of approaches across the length and breadth of any enterprise. There are several implications of using such a variety of approaches --- chief amongst which is the reconciliation effect expended every time a deviation has to be managed, exceptions have to be handled or a change introduced in any activity. Targeting efficiency of reconciliations through techniques such as focus-groups, standardization of documentation etc. is a typical response of most organizations. Taking the intuitive notion of a Business Identity (as a conceptual anchor for an organization\u2019s engagement with its stakeholders) forward, enterprises can benefit from using a simple, organization-wide concept anchor focused around \u201cwhy is it done\u201d for its activities. This anchor need not be prescriptive to change the way an organization manages its activities but descriptive to enhance the ability to more effectively leverage information within the artifacts. One candidate for such an intuitive anchor is the contract. In fact, a contract may initially take the form of a memorandum of understanding ( MOU ), an agreement outlined in a formal document that may later become a legal contract. If we take the Business Identity as a basis for viewing an organization\u2019s product and services, a contract can be seen as a specific engagement around which the activities of various departments and teams are organized. More specifically, a contract can be seen as a collection of related commitments, potentially spread over time, which provide the necessary context for any activity in an organization. Interestingly, while it's well-understood that a contract is a definitive source of specifics around any agreement with stakeholders, it's currently referred to only in the extreme case of legal recourse in handling disagreements. Another perception of contracts is that they do not cover all collaboration contexts which guide activities in an organization. Contracts have several features which help align the Business Identity with the activities within an enterprise --- and the wider ecosystem, for that matter. Together with the legal system and societal norms, contracts provide a contextual basis for belief/trust between an enterprise and its stakeholders in the ecosystem Contracts are specific to the parties involved and provide an ideal contextual basis for (hyper)personalisation of products and services --- through bounded simulation of contract performance Measures of performance in organizational activities, such as cost, operational efficiencies and innovation effectiveness can be aligned to contractual performance contexts We now look at two key elements of organizational activity (enabled by EKG ) aimed at orienting and realizing business strategy, through the lens of Business Identity and Contracts: Business Strategy Actuation is a business identity oriented process that senses, understands and communicates business outcome-based assessment data to focus energy and resources on strategic objectives. Actuation measurement values are used to assess whether strategic objectives and associated business goals are being fulfilled. Business Model Elaboration is the process of providing further detail of business strategy. It may include decision rationale that explains how the business identity data infrastructure and algorithms enable the how and why planned actions would create, deliver, and capture value. Business Enablers utilizes Business Identity to scope the EKG facts and facets that are needed to have a single source of truth about each of their Suppliers, Partners and Consumers. For example, when a Business Identity point to point relationship with the Identities of all their Customers is enabled, implementors have much greater clarity about what must be governed, collected, analyzed, and securely stored.

The artifacts take a variety of forms ranging from free-form documentation of manuals, data and process models along different methodologies to data records and programming repositories. Business Capability Models, Business Canvas, Business Reference Architectures etc have been some of the outputs used to serve as organization-wide references of activities. The objectives guiding such management are mostly around efficiency of categorizing, storing and retrieval, focused around \u201cwhat is done\u201d and \u201cwho does it\u201d. The key challenge in efficiency oriented approaches is that the perception can be quite subjective based on the needs of the departments or teams --- which leads to a variety of approaches across the length and breadth of any enterprise. There are several implications of using such a variety of approaches --- chief amongst which is the reconciliation effect expended every time a deviation has to be managed, exceptions have to be handled or a change introduced in any activity. Targeting efficiency of reconciliations through techniques such as focus-groups, standardization of documentation etc. is a typical response of most organizations. Taking the intuitive notion of a Business Identity (as a conceptual anchor for an organization\u2019s engagement with its stakeholders) forward, enterprises can benefit from using a simple, organization-wide concept anchor focused around \u201cwhy is it done\u201d for its activities. This anchor need not be prescriptive to change the way an organization manages its activities but descriptive to enhance the ability to more effectively leverage information within the artifacts. One candidate for such an intuitive anchor is the contract. In fact, a contract may initially take the form of a memorandum of understanding ( MOU ), an agreement outlined in a formal document that may later become a legal contract. If we take the Business Identity as a basis for viewing an organization\u2019s product and services, a contract can be seen as a specific engagement around which the activities of various departments and teams are organized. More specifically, a contract can be seen as a collection of related commitments, potentially spread over time, which provide the necessary context for any activity in an organization. Interestingly, while it's well-understood that a contract is a definitive source of specifics around any agreement with stakeholders, it's currently referred to only in the extreme case of legal recourse in handling disagreements. Another perception of contracts is that they do not cover all collaboration contexts which guide activities in an organization. Contracts have several features which help align the Business Identity with the activities within an enterprise --- and the wider ecosystem, for that matter. Together with the legal system and societal norms, contracts provide a contextual basis for belief/trust between an enterprise and its stakeholders in the ecosystem Contracts are specific to the parties involved and provide an ideal contextual basis for (hyper)personalisation of products and services --- through bounded simulation of contract performance Measures of performance in organizational activities, such as cost, operational efficiencies and innovation effectiveness can be aligned to contractual performance contexts We now look at two key elements of organizational activity (enabled by EKG ) aimed at orienting and realizing business strategy, through the lens of Business Identity and Contracts: Business Strategy Actuation is a business identity oriented process that senses, understands and communicates business outcome-based assessment data to focus energy and resources on strategic objectives.

A Business Identity can link brand statements such as the above with the wider contexts of an Enterprise\u2019s corporate values, vision etc and the specifics of the product/service features and integration with other products/services of the enterprise/wider ecosystem.","title":"Business Identity"},{"location":"pillar-dev/business/background-and-intro/#aligning-business-identity-with-activities-in-an-enterprise","text":"Enterprises use a variety of mechanisms today to organize \u201cinventories\u201d of their activities. The artifacts take a variety of forms ranging from free-form documentation of manuals, data and process models along different methodologies to data records and programming repositories. Business Capability Models, Business Canvas, Business Reference Architectures etc have been some of the outputs used to serve as organization-wide references of activities. The objectives guiding such management are mostly around efficiency of categorizing, storing and retrieval, focused around \u201cwhat is done\u201d and \u201cwho does it\u201d. The key challenge in efficiency oriented approaches is that the perception can be quite subjective based on the needs of the departments or teams --- which leads to a variety of approaches across the length and breadth of any enterprise. There are several implications of using such a variety of approaches --- chief amongst which is the reconciliation effect expended every time a deviation has to be managed, exceptions have to be handled or a change introduced in any activity. Targeting efficiency of reconciliations through techniques such as focus-groups, standardization of documentation etc. is a typical response of most organizations. Taking the intuitive notion of a Business Identity (as a conceptual anchor for an organization\u2019s engagement with its stakeholders) forward, enterprises can benefit from using a simple, organization-wide concept anchor focused around \u201cwhy is it done\u201d for its activities. This anchor need not be prescriptive to change the way an organization manages its activities but descriptive to enhance the ability to more effectively leverage information within the artifacts. One candidate for such an intuitive anchor is the contract. In fact, a contract may initially take the form of a memorandum of understanding ( MOU ), an agreement outlined in a formal document that may later become a legal contract. If we take the Business Identity as a basis for viewing an organization\u2019s product and services, a contract can be seen as a specific engagement around which the activities of various departments and teams are organized. More specifically, a contract can be seen as a collection of related commitments, potentially spread over time, which provide the necessary context for any activity in an organization. Interestingly, while it's well-understood that a contract is a definitive source of specifics around any agreement with stakeholders, it's currently referred to only in the extreme case of legal recourse in handling disagreements. Another perception of contracts is that they do not cover all collaboration contexts which guide activities in an organization. Contracts have several features which help align the Business Identity with the activities within an enterprise --- and the wider ecosystem, for that matter. Together with the legal system and societal norms, contracts provide a contextual basis for belief/trust between an enterprise and its stakeholders in the ecosystem Contracts are specific to the parties involved and provide an ideal contextual basis for (hyper)personalisation of products and services --- through bounded simulation of contract performance Measures of performance in organizational activities, such as cost, operational efficiencies and innovation effectiveness can be aligned to contractual performance contexts We now look at two key elements of organizational activity (enabled by EKG ) aimed at orienting and realizing business strategy, through the lens of Business Identity and Contracts: Business Strategy Actuation is a business identity oriented process that senses, understands and communicates business outcome-based assessment data to focus energy and resources on strategic objectives. Actuation measurement values are used to assess whether strategic objectives and associated business goals are being fulfilled. Business Model Elaboration is the process of providing further detail of business strategy. It may include decision rationale that explains how the business identity data infrastructure and algorithms enable the how and why planned actions would create, deliver, and capture value. Business Enablers utilizes Business Identity to scope the EKG facts and facets that are needed to have a single source of truth about each of their Suppliers, Partners and Consumers. For example, when a Business Identity point to point relationship with the Identities of all their Customers is enabled, implementors have much greater clarity about what must be governed, collected, analyzed, and securely stored.

Summary Intro Dimensions Levels Value Traditional Approach EKG Approach Use cases The capability Capability Map (A.3.6) is part of the capability area Business Enablers in the Business Pillar . Defining what a business does and which outcomes it wants to achieve. Understanding what a business does is at least as important as understanding how it does it. Focusing on the what rather than on the how often provides the right level of abstraction of complex ecosystems in a way that can be easily digested by business executives and planning teams. In recent years, the word capability has steadily been drawing attention in the business world as a way to narrow the gap between business and IT. A capability is described by Ulrich and Rosen, (p.1, 2011) as: A business capability, or simply a \u201ccapability,\u201d defines what a business does. It does not communicate or expose where, why, or how something is done---only what is done. Specifically, the business capability is \u201ca particular ability or capacity that a business may possess or exchange to achieve a specific purpose or outcome. Understanding what a business does is at least as important as understanding how it does it. Focusing on the what rather than on the how often provides the right level of abstraction of complex ecosystems in a way that can be easily digested by business executives and planning teams. Dissecting a business as a set of basic capabilities allows one to view complex organizations and business environments in a wide range of different ways. Additionally, one could zoom in on lower levels of abstraction to reach higher levels of detail depending on the needs of the target audience. Consider the example of the high-level capability called customer 360\u00b0 . This capability refers to having a complete picture of the customer and this is a capability many organizations may benefit from. A customer may be called a taxpayer in the context of a government institution, a patient in the context of a hospital and a student in the context of a university. Being able to manage different aspects of a customer might be imperative for many businesses depending on their business strategy. For instance, customer 360\u00b0 as a high-level capability could entail the customer trend analysis and customer management information capabilities as lower-level capabilities. In other words, this means that capabilities are concerns that could be refined into lower-level capabilities that in turn could be further refined. The advantage of functional decomposition in this hierarchical and modular way is that it increases the reusability of capabilities across business lines, enterprises or even industries. Additionally, decomposing capabilities in different levels of abstraction offers a better sense of how capabilities fit in on the overall view of the enterprise. Capabilities should follow certain principles as follows: Capabilities define what a business does and not how a business does it. This implies that a capability does not refer to a process or value stream. Capabilities are nouns, not verbs. To make the distinction between a capability and a process, capabilities should be named with nouns such as customer management instead of a verb managing customers. Capabilities should be defined in business term and not in technical terms. Executives and other business professionals should be able to clearly understand what a capability means ---and take ownership of it---without being bothered with the technical details of the systems that implement it. Capabilities should be stable (i.e. least volatile) as possible. There is a fundamental set of high-level capabilities that are necessary to run a business regardless of the sector of industry it is located in. Additionally, high-level capabilities may rarely change within an organization unless there are significant changes to its business strategy or organization. Capabilities are not redundant. Capabilities appear once and only once on a capability maps even though they are shared by more than division, business line or business unit of an enterprise. There should only be one business capability map per business. In order to bring transparency across the organization, there should be a single unified and harmonized business capability map per business. Therefore, business capabilities spread throughout different business units, divisions, department, lines of business, etc should be only appear once in the business capability map. Capabilities map to---but are not the same as---business processes, business units, Lines of Business (LOBs) and value streams. There is rarely a one-to-one mapping between a business process, a business unit, an LOB or a value stream, and a capability. Therefore, mistaking a capability with one these other concepts may result in an overly complex overview of things that are constantly repeated across the enterprise. Additionally, we\u2019re trying to understand the what rather than the how and this would not be possible if capabilities are mistaken with process-related concepts. Automated capabilities are still business capabilities and not IT capabilities. Capabilities are owned by the business as they are made by and for the business. Therefore, a capability that has been automated with an IT system is not an IT capability. Instead, it is nothing else than an automated business capability . Capabilities are the most valuable when incorporated in the overall pictures of a business\u2019 ecosystem. While being useful in a stand-alone basis for discussion and planning, capabilities fulfil their biggest potential by being combined into a larger business capability map that represents the business ecosystem of an enterprise.

Scale 1 to 5. Notes: the who, what, when and how is more important for the other pillars Here is how the maturity levels of developing a capability map with an Enterprise Knowledge Graph ( EKG ) might progress: EKG initiation : At this stage, the organization has just begun using an EKG to develop a capability map. The EKG may be used to store and manage data on the organization's capabilities, but it is not yet fully integrated into the organization's processes and systems. Extensible platform : At this stage, the organization has made significant progress in integrating the EKG into its processes and systems, and is using it to manage and update the capability map on an ongoing basis. The EKG has become an important tool for storing and organizing data on the organization's capabilities, and is being used to inform decision-making and strategic planning. Enterprise ready : At this stage, the EKG is a fully integrated and essential part of the organization's operations. It is being used to manage and update the capability map in real-time, and is providing valuable insights and information to help the organization make informed decisions. Strategic asset : At this stage, the EKG is seen as a strategic asset by the organization, and is being used to drive innovation and competitive advantage. It is being used to identify new opportunities and areas for growth, and to develop strategies to build and strengthen the organization's capabilities. Operational ecosystem : At this final stage, the EKG has become a key part of the organization's operational ecosystem, seamlessly integrating with other systems and processes to support the organization's operations and decision-making. The capability map is an integral part of this ecosystem, providing a clear and comprehensive view of the organization's capabilities and how they align with its goals and objectives. Levels \u00b6 Warn Work in progress Contribution to the EKG \u00b6 The Business Capability Map enables an enterprise to structure their Enterprise Knowledge Graph. Each capability is a candidate to become a use case for the EKG . A well-designed mature EKG is a facade in front of all technical and organizational silos which means that---without any further structure---users do not experience the negative effects of these silos anymore. In many ways that may be a good thing but having silos---or different perspectives---can also be necessary. The EKG allows an organization to rethink their silos without being held back by their current data or technology landscape (or \"technical debt\"). The Business Capability Map is the ideal initial structure for the new EKG \"silos\". Business Capability Maps are usually rather coarse-grained and visualized in a three-level hierarchy whereas the structure of the EKG goes much further than that. Translating each capability to a use case is a good start but each of these use cases can be further broken down into smaller use cases where each use case becomes a highly reusable component of the EKG . This leads to a hierarchical structure---a taxonomy so you will---of all use cases, also called \"the Use Case Tree\" (UCT). This use case tree, at the higher levels, corresponds with the Business Capability Map and allows a business and its executives to \"own\" and control all the various parts of their EKG . Contribution to the Enterprise \u00b6 As a business/IT transformation enabler, capabilities may provide certain benefits to enterprises: Capabilities provide business with a common language. Capabilities offer business professionals and C-level executives a common understanding of which areas of an enterprise they need to address. The larger the enterprise, the more useful this idea is since business issues and strategy may revolve around many business units, lines of business, business processes, or even enterprise boundaries. Capabilities may enable more precise investments. Measuring the ROI of investment projects can be very difficult as the results might be spread across a myriad of different LOBs or business units. Instead of reconciling results from all these different places, one could merely look at the resources being allocated at a certain capability and this may allow business executives to have better estimates of the impact of their investments on the enterprise as a whole . Capabilities serve as a baseline for strategic planning, change management and impact analysis. By shifting the focus from business units, lines of business, IT systems and business processes to business capabilities, one is able to increase the traceability of strategic decisions into the daily operations and the business performance of the enterprise as a whole . So, capabilities serve as a starting point for tracking the impact horizontal and vertical impacts of strategic and tactical decisions from the executive team. Capabilities lead to better business service specification and design. Capabilities provide business-focused abstraction of the functionalities and information that information systems must provide. For instance, such capabilities may help in the selection or construction of services in a SOA as they directly embody business requirements. In a few words, capabilities provide business executives the possibility to cut through the complexity inherent to most enterprises in order to make sounder decisions for strategic planning, impact analysis and investment planning. Using capabilities enables business to make decisions based on what needs to be resolved without initially dealing with the how . At the same time, it provides a way to tie the how to the results of the _what_for further validation that business efforts are delivery the expected results and for better alignment. On the other hand, the alternative to this approach involves repeating the traditional silo-focused approach of looking at hundreds or even thousands of IT systems, before being able to look at actual business actions and business results. Without an Enterprise Knowledge Graph ( EKG ), the development of a capability map would likely involve manually gathering data on the capabilities that are important to your organization. This could involve reviewing internal documents, conducting market research, and seeking input from experts within the organization. Once the data has been collected, you would need to manually organize and structure it in a way that allows you to create a visual representation of your organization's capabilities. This could be in the form of a diagram, chart, or other visual tool. Without the EKG , you would also need to find a way to store and manage the data that you have collected. This could involve creating and maintaining manual records, or using a separate database or spreadsheet tool. Finally, you would need to find a way to link the capabilities on the map to related information and resources, such as training materials, best practices, and case studies. This could involve manually searching for and compiling this information, or relying on other tools or systems to help you access and organize it. Overall, the development of a capability map without an EKG would likely be more time-consuming and labor-intensive, as it would involve manually gathering and organizing data, and finding ways to access and link related information and resources. Moreover, certain capabilities may not be able to be implemented with other technologies but EKG . Warn Work in progress, describe how this capability is possibly being delivered today in a non- EKG context and optionally what the issues are that EKG could or should improve A capability map is a visual representation of the capabilities of an organization or business unit. It is typically used to identify areas of strength and areas that need improvement, and can be used to guide strategic planning and decision-making. To develop a capability map with an Enterprise Knowledge Graph ( EKG ), you would first need to identify the capabilities that are important to your organization. Next, you would need to gather data on these capabilities. This could include data on the current state of each capability, as well as information on trends and changes over time. This data could come from a variety of sources, including internal documents, market research, and external experts. Once you have collected this data, you can use it to create a visual representation of your organization's capabilities. This could be in the form of a diagram, chart, or other visual tool. The EKG can then be used to store and manage this data, allowing you to easily access and update the capability map as needed. The EKG can also be used to link the capabilities on the map to related information and resources, such as training materials, best practices, and case studies. This can help to provide context and depth to the map, and can help to identify opportunities for growth and improvement. Finally, the EKG could also be used to implement such capabilities and even to implement strategic capabilities such as Customer 360\u00b0. Warn Work in progress, describe how this capability would be delivered or supported using an EKG approach, making the link to the \"how\" i.e. the EKG /Method . There are several potential use cases for a capability map, including: Identifying strengths and weaknesses : A capability map can help an organization identify its areas of strength and weakness, allowing it to focus on areas where it excels and identify opportunities for improvement in areas where it may be lacking. Strategic planning : A capability map can be used to inform strategic planning and decision-making by providing a clear understanding of the organization's current capabilities and how they align with its goals and objectives. Resource allocation : A capability map can help an organization allocate resources more effectively by identifying areas where additional investment may be needed to build or strengthen capabilities. Talent management : A capability map can be used to identify gaps in an organization's talent and to develop strategies for attracting and retaining employees with the necessary skills and expertise. Collaboration and coordination : A capability map can help an organization understand the capabilities of other business units or departments, facilitating collaboration and coordination across the organization. Communication : A capability map can be used to communicate the capabilities of an organization to stakeholders, including customers, partners, and investors. Change management : A capability map can help an organization understand the impacts of changes to its business model, processes, or systems, and identify any necessary changes to its capabilities in response. Mergers and acquisitions : A capability map can be used to identify overlaps and gaps in capabilities between two organizations during the due diligence process of a merger or acquisition. Innovation : A capability map can help an organization identify areas where it has the necessary capabilities to pursue new opportunities or ideas, or where it may need to build new capabilities in order to innovate. Benchmarking : A capability map can be used to compare the capabilities of an organization to those of its competitors or peers, allowing it to identify areas where it may have an advantage or disadvantage. Risk assessment : A capability map can help an organization identify areas where it may be vulnerable due to a lack of capabilities, and develop strategies to mitigate these risks. Customer relationship management : A capability map can be used to understand the capabilities that are important to customers, and to identify areas where the organization can differentiate itself from its competitors.

Warn Work in progress, describe how this capability is possibly being delivered today in a non- EKG context and optionally what the issues are that EKG could or should improve A capability map is a visual representation of the capabilities of an organization or business unit. It is typically used to identify areas of strength and areas that need improvement, and can be used to guide strategic planning and decision-making. To develop a capability map with an Enterprise Knowledge Graph ( EKG ), you would first need to identify the capabilities that are important to your organization. Next, you would need to gather data on these capabilities. This could include data on the current state of each capability, as well as information on trends and changes over time. This data could come from a variety of sources, including internal documents, market research, and external experts. Once you have collected this data, you can use it to create a visual representation of your organization's capabilities. This could be in the form of a diagram, chart, or other visual tool. The EKG can then be used to store and manage this data, allowing you to easily access and update the capability map as needed. The EKG can also be used to link the capabilities on the map to related information and resources, such as training materials, best practices, and case studies. This can help to provide context and depth to the map, and can help to identify opportunities for growth and improvement. Finally, the EKG could also be used to implement such capabilities and even to implement strategic capabilities such as Customer 360\u00b0. Warn Work in progress, describe how this capability would be delivered or supported using an EKG approach, making the link to the \"how\" i.e. the EKG /Method . There are several potential use cases for a capability map, including: Identifying strengths and weaknesses : A capability map can help an organization identify its areas of strength and weakness, allowing it to focus on areas where it excels and identify opportunities for improvement in areas where it may be lacking. Strategic planning : A capability map can be used to inform strategic planning and decision-making by providing a clear understanding of the organization's current capabilities and how they align with its goals and objectives. Resource allocation : A capability map can help an organization allocate resources more effectively by identifying areas where additional investment may be needed to build or strengthen capabilities. Talent management : A capability map can be used to identify gaps in an organization's talent and to develop strategies for attracting and retaining employees with the necessary skills and expertise. Collaboration and coordination : A capability map can help an organization understand the capabilities of other business units or departments, facilitating collaboration and coordination across the organization. Communication : A capability map can be used to communicate the capabilities of an organization to stakeholders, including customers, partners, and investors. Change management : A capability map can help an organization understand the impacts of changes to its business model, processes, or systems, and identify any necessary changes to its capabilities in response. Mergers and acquisitions : A capability map can be used to identify overlaps and gaps in capabilities between two organizations during the due diligence process of a merger or acquisition. Innovation : A capability map can help an organization identify areas where it has the necessary capabilities to pursue new opportunities or ideas, or where it may need to build new capabilities in order to innovate. Benchmarking : A capability map can be used to compare the capabilities of an organization to those of its competitors or peers, allowing it to identify areas where it may have an advantage or disadvantage. Risk assessment : A capability map can help an organization identify areas where it may be vulnerable due to a lack of capabilities, and develop strategies to mitigate these risks. Customer relationship management : A capability map can be used to understand the capabilities that are important to customers, and to identify areas where the organization can differentiate itself from its competitors.

Operating Model \u00b6 The desired level of business process integration & standardization. Summary Intro Dimensions Levels Value Traditional Approach EKG Approach Use cases The capability Operating Model (A.3.1) is part of the capability area Business Enablers in the Business Pillar . The desired level of business process integration & standardization. Operating Models 1 are the foundations of execution, in support of an enterprise's strategy. Enterprises use operating models to organize and coordinate their activities in order to most effectively engage with their customers and business partners. At its simplest, an Operating Model enables an Enterprise to realise its vision and strategy at the level of everyday execution --- business operations. An operating model --- or lack of it --- has a profound impact on how a company implements its business processes and organizes supporting technologies. Depending on an enterprise's Business Models, multiple operating models, at corporate and unit/divisional levels, could co-exist, in pursuit of the business strategy. In order to define an operating model at any of these different levels, Enterprises need to answer the following two questions: To what extent is the successful completion of one business unit\u2019s operations/transactions dependent on the availability, accuracy, and timeliness of other business unit\u2019s information? To what extent does the enterprise benefit by having business units run their operations in the same way? The first question determines integration requirements while the second one covers the standardization requirements of an Enterprise. Note 80% of CEOs in one study claim to have transformations in place to make their businesses more digital; 87% expect to see a change in their operating models within three years. In today's modern dynamic economic environment, Enterprises have to contend with a variety of choices in the selection, ongoing evaluation and transformation of their operating models. Such choices are necessitated by a fast-changing competitive landscape and the accompanying need to constantly align the workforce capacity and capabilities to business tactics. Typical triggers of consideration include comparative metrics such as higher-than-peer Cost-to-Income Ratios in key product portfolios, costs per transaction, Net Promoter Score/CSI, time-to-market for new products et al. While practices around specifics of Operating Models vary across Enterprises, we highlight below a few key focus areas in the setup and transformation of their operating models and in such a context, how EKGs can act as effective enablers: Integration \u00b6 Effective coordination across silos of activities with disjoint goals in any given external interaction (customer or stakeholder) In the Introductory section, we have introduced the idea of using Contracts as an intuitive anchor for coordinating activities in an enterprise, towards its engagements with customers and stakeholders. An Operating Model can leverage the context of \"why\" and \"what\" in the contracts and specify the \"who\" and \"how\" to align and link various activities within a business unit, across business units and across enterprise boundaries. Many enterprises are using the concept of \"User/Customer Journeys\" to align and link cross unit activities in their Operating Models --- such User/Customer Journeys can be considered to be instance models of Contract execution, enabling Enterprises to assess and select appropriate features in their Operating Models. Standardization \u00b6 Trade-offs between Individual Efficiency and Overall Effectiveness in the business processes A key challenge many enterprises face is in the choice between improving efficiencies focused on individual business processes and effectiveness of the overall end-to-end business flow. In the introductory section, we have introduced the idea of using Business Identities as intuitive anchor for an Enterprise\u2019s engagement with its stakeholders. To address the trade-off challenge on individual vs collective efficiency in its business processes, an Enterprise\u2019s Business Identity can help in (a) aligning the guidance of the enterprise's vision/mission/values to the trade-off and (b) ensuring consistency in practices and tools, through standardization, in the execution of business processes.

The interrelationship, in the context of strategic objectives, can enable risk management to evaluate and monitor risk in a holistic manner. Qualitative and subjective metrics to more quantitative and objective metrics based risk management practices: Narrowly focused risk factors, owing to siloed specialisations have led to use of predominantly qualitative metrics in risk monitoring.

Assessing scalability (work in progress). TODO Business scalability assessment \u00b6 What is business scalability? \u00b6 Business scalability refers to a company's ability to grow and handle increased demand for its products or services without being hindered by its internal processes and systems. In other words, a scalable business is one that can easily adapt to changes in demand and continue to operate efficiently and effectively, regardless of how quickly the business is growing. This is often achieved through a combination of factors such as having a solid business plan, using efficient and flexible systems and technologies, and having a team of employees who are able to adapt to new challenges. By having a scalable business, a company can more easily expand its operations and increase its profits over time. What is business scalability assessment? \u00b6 A business scalability assessment is a process through which a company evaluates its ability to handle growth and increase in demand for its products or services. This typically involves examining various aspects of the business, such as its internal processes and systems, its market position, and its overall financial health. The goal of a business scalability assessment is to identify any potential bottlenecks or constraints that could hinder the company's ability to grow and adapt to changing market conditions, and to develop strategies for addressing these issues. This can help a company ensure that it is well-positioned to take advantage of opportunities for growth and to avoid potential pitfalls that could hamper its ability to scale up its operations. The dimensions of business scalability assessment can vary depending on the specific needs and goals of the organization. However, some common dimensions that are typically considered when assessing the scalability of a business include: Financial scalability : This dimension looks at the organization's ability to generate sufficient revenue to support its growth and expansion.

This would typically involve manually evaluating the data and information collected and analyzed in previous steps, and comparing it to industry benchmarks and best practices. Review and refine the assessment : The final step would be to review and refine the scalability assessment, based on feedback from stakeholders and further analysis. This would typically involve iterative cycles of review, refinement, and validation, to ensure that the assessment accurately reflects the organization's scalability and potential for growth. Without an enterprise knowledge graph, the scalability assessment would be a time-consuming and labor-intensive process, with limited flexibility and scalability. It would be difficult to maintain and update the assessment as the organization evolves, and it would be challenging to use the assessment to drive decision-making and strategic planning. Warn Work in progress, describe how this capability is possibly being delivered today How can EKG enable composable business? \u00b6 An enterprise knowledge graph ( EKG ) can boost reuse, replicable modularity, and speed in several ways. First, by providing a single, unified view of an organization's data, an EKG can help businesses to identify and leverage data that can be used in multiple contexts, allowing them to quickly and easily combine different pieces of information to create new insights and solutions. This can facilitate the reuse of data across different parts of the organization, helping to reduce duplication of effort and to improve efficiency. Second, an EKG can also help businesses to more easily replicate and modularize their data and processes. By providing a standard way to connect and access data, an EKG can enable businesses to quickly and easily set up new operations in new locations or markets, and to combine different components and modules to create new products and services. This can help businesses to adapt to changing market conditions and to respond to increased demand for their products or services, allowing them to scale up their operations more easily and effectively. Finally, an EKG can also enable businesses to operate more quickly and efficiently. By providing a framework for organizing and analyzing data, an EKG can help businesses to access the information they need to make strategic decisions more quickly and easily. This can help businesses to respond to changing market conditions and to take advantage of new opportunities for growth and expansion, supporting their efforts to become more composable and scalable. How could EKG help organizations obtain economies of scale? \u00b6 An enterprise knowledge graph can provide economies of scale by enabling businesses to more efficiently and effectively manage their data and processes. By providing a single, unified view of an organization's data, a knowledge graph can help businesses to identify and leverage data that can be used in multiple contexts, reducing duplication of effort and improving efficiency.

How can EKG enable business scalability assessment? \u00b6 An enterprise knowledge graph can help organizations with business scalability assessment by providing a framework for organizing and analyzing data, and by enabling businesses to quickly and easily access the information they need to make strategic decisions. By connecting and organizing data from multiple sources, a knowledge graph can provide a comprehensive view of an organization's operations, allowing businesses to identify potential bottlenecks or constraints that could hinder their ability to grow and adapt to changing market conditions. This can help businesses to develop strategies for addressing these issues and to improve their overall scalability. In addition, a knowledge graph can also provide businesses with insights into their market position, competitors, and potential opportunities for growth, helping them to make more informed decisions about their future direction and expansion plans. An enterprise knowledge graph ( EKG ) can help overcome some of the drawbacks of the traditional approach for business scalability assessment by providing a centralized, accessible repository of information about the organization and its capabilities. This can help teams and individuals within the organization quickly and easily access the data and information they need to assess the organization's scalability, reducing the time and resources required for the assessment. Additionally, the EKG can provide a more objective, data-driven approach to assessing the organization's scalability. By providing detailed, accurate, and up-to-date information about the organization's capabilities, market conditions, and financial performance, the EKG can help teams and individuals make more informed and objective assessments of the organization's scalability. This can help the organization more accurately and effectively evaluate its scalability, and can support more effective decision-making and resource allocation. Finally, the EKG can help the organization continuously monitor and assess its scalability over time. By providing real-time, up-to-date information about the organization's capabilities and performance, the EKG can help teams and individuals within the organization stay informed about changes and developments that may affect the organization's scalability. This can help the organization more effectively respond to changes in the market and its own capabilities, and can support ongoing efforts to improve and expand its scalability. How would business scalability assessment look like with EKG ? \u00b6 With an enterprise knowledge graph, the scalability assessment would be a more efficient and effective process, with greater flexibility and scalability. An enterprise knowledge graph is a centralized, interconnected, and dynamic representation of an organization's knowledge, and it can be used to capture, organize, and access data and information from multiple sources and formats. With an enterprise knowledge graph, the scalability assessment would typically involve the following steps: Identify the objectives and criteria of the assessment : The first step would be to identify the goals and objectives of the scalability assessment, as well as the criteria and metrics that will be used to evaluate the organization's scalability. This would typically involve defining the relevant entities, attributes, and relationships in the knowledge graph, using a standardized ontology and schema. Collect and integrate data : The next step would be to collect and integrate the data and information needed to conduct the scalability assessment. This would typically involve using the knowledge graph as a central platform for accessing and integrating data from multiple sources, such as internal databases, external sources, and interviews with subject matter experts. Analyze and classify the data : The next step would be to analyze and classify the data, to identify the key drivers and barriers to scalability for the organization. This would typically involve using the knowledge graph as a basis for applying advanced analytics and machine learning algorithms, to automatically classify and cluster the data, and identify patterns and trends. Conduct the scalability assessment : The next step would be to conduct the actual scalability assessment, using the criteria and metrics identified in the previous step. This would typically involve using the knowledge graph as a source of data and information, and using visualization tools and libraries to automatically generate the assessment, based on pre-defined templates and criteria. Review and refine the assessment : The final step would be to review and refine the scalability assessment, based on feedback from stakeholders and further analysis. This would typically involve using the knowledge graph as a platform for collaboration, feedback, and validation, to ensure that the assessment accurately reflects the organization's scalability and potential for growth. With an enterprise knowledge graph, the scalability assessment would be a more efficient, effective, and dynamic process, with greater flexibility and scalability.

With an enterprise knowledge graph, the scalability assessment would typically involve the following steps: Identify the objectives and criteria of the assessment : The first step would be to identify the goals and objectives of the scalability assessment, as well as the criteria and metrics that will be used to evaluate the organization's scalability. This would typically involve defining the relevant entities, attributes, and relationships in the knowledge graph, using a standardized ontology and schema. Collect and integrate data : The next step would be to collect and integrate the data and information needed to conduct the scalability assessment. This would typically involve using the knowledge graph as a central platform for accessing and integrating data from multiple sources, such as internal databases, external sources, and interviews with subject matter experts. Analyze and classify the data : The next step would be to analyze and classify the data, to identify the key drivers and barriers to scalability for the organization. This would typically involve using the knowledge graph as a basis for applying advanced analytics and machine learning algorithms, to automatically classify and cluster the data, and identify patterns and trends. Conduct the scalability assessment : The next step would be to conduct the actual scalability assessment, using the criteria and metrics identified in the previous step. This would typically involve using the knowledge graph as a source of data and information, and using visualization tools and libraries to automatically generate the assessment, based on pre-defined templates and criteria. Review and refine the assessment : The final step would be to review and refine the scalability assessment, based on feedback from stakeholders and further analysis. This would typically involve using the knowledge graph as a platform for collaboration, feedback, and validation, to ensure that the assessment accurately reflects the organization's scalability and potential for growth. With an enterprise knowledge graph, the scalability assessment would be a more efficient, effective, and dynamic process, with greater flexibility and scalability. It would be easier to maintain and update the assessment as the organization evolves, and it would be more powerful and useful in driving decision-making and strategic planning. Warn Work in progress, describe how this capability would be delivered or supported using an EKG approach, making the link to the \"how\" i.e. the EKG /Method . Business scalability assessment is a process of evaluating the potential for a business to grow and increase its operations without incurring significant additional costs. This is typically done by identifying the key factors that enable a business to scale, such as its business model, operational processes, and technology infrastructure. Some common use cases for business scalability assessment include: Identifying areas of a business that can be streamlined or automated in order to increase efficiency and reduce costs. Developing strategies for expanding into new markets or launching new products. Evaluating the potential impact of new technologies on a business and developing plans for incorporating them into the existing operations. Determining the feasibility of implementing new processes or systems to support growth, such as supply chain management, customer relationship management, or financial management. Assessing the potential risks and challenges associated with scaling a business, such as increased competition, regulatory changes, or market shifts. Identifying potential partnerships or acquisitions that could support the growth of a business. Developing strategies for attracting and retaining top talent to support the expansion of a business Evaluating the potential impact of new regulations or industry standards on a business and developing plans for complying with them Determining the feasibility of implementing new technologies, such as cloud computing or artificial intelligence, to support the growth of a business. Assessing the potential impact of external factors, such as changes in consumer behavior or the economy, on the growth potential of a business.

What are the five maturity levels of business scalability assessment? \u00b6 The five maturity levels of business scalability assessment are a framework for evaluating the current level of scalability of a business and identifying areas for improvement. These levels are: Initial : At this level, a business has minimal scalability, with little ability to handle increased demand or growth. Repeatable : At this level, a business has established processes and systems in place that allow it to handle increased demand in a consistent and predictable manner. Defined : At this level, a business has fully documented processes and systems in place, enabling it to easily replicate its operations and handle increased demand. Managed : At this level, a business has advanced systems and processes in place to actively monitor and manage its scalability, allowing it to quickly adapt to changing demand. Optimized : At this level, a business has fully optimized its systems and processes for scalability, allowing it to handle large increases in demand with ease. By regularly assessing its scalability maturity level, a business can identify areas for improvement and take steps to increase its ability to handle increased demand and growth. This can help the business grow and succeed in a competitive market. Which role will EKG play at each maturity level? \u00b6 The role of an enterprise knowledge graph ( EKG ) varies depending on the maturity level of the business. In general, however, an EKG can help a business at any level by providing a centralized, structured repository of knowledge that can be easily accessed and used by employees. At the initial level, an EKG can help a business by providing a foundation for organizing and storing knowledge, allowing it to better manage its information and make more informed decisions. At the repeatable level, an EKG can help a business by enabling it to easily share and access knowledge across the organization, improving collaboration and consistency. At the defined level, an EKG can help a business by providing a structured and standardized way to represent knowledge, making it easier to analyze and use. At the managed level, an EKG can help a business by providing real-time insights and analytics, allowing it to actively monitor and manage its knowledge and make more informed decisions.

Many such individuals might represent the same real world object. data value strings, numbers, dates which represent the data. property a type of data point that may be associated with individuals. An individual, a property and a value --- which may be a data value or another individual --- form a triple. For example person X hasBirthDate D or person X hasMother Y . Triples whose value is another individual form relationships. Properties may have generalizations, for example hasMother is a subProperty of hasParent . class a category applied to individuals, that determines what you can do with them, the properties you can expect to see, and the rules that might apply; an individual may be a member of many classes associated; classes may have generalizations. Note that, unlike more traditional approaches, properties are independent of classes or class membership.

The link to precise meaning serves to mitigate problems created using the same word with multiple definitions; and the challenges of expressing conceptual nuance using multiple informal sentences. In the other direction, from ontology to vocabulary, it should be possible to generate a business glossary directly from ontologies for a given scope. Since they should capture the meaning of concepts applicable to an organization, or an even broader ecosystem, the choice of concepts to include in an EKG should be driven by business use cases. And different overlapping ontologies may be included and mapped to cover different relevant aspects. Likewise, it should be possible to generate---and map to---models for more conventional tools from ontologies, by applying technology-specific rules. Semantic modeling also eliminates the problem of hard-coding assumptions about the world into a single data model. And while multiple ontologies may coexist, they are able to be mapped and connected to each other. In a mature environment, the data modeling process drives technology implementation, by defining the detailed data structures and associated APIs. These components---along with functional code---are included as part of the testing suite within the EKG to facilitate rapid deployment. Different types of external data models are not needed in EKG but can be mapped to or generated. In fact, physical data modelers are a community with their own vocabulary. Constraints/shapes for models are applied by context (use case)---there is no Single Version of the Truth (SVOT) for the EKG as a whole. Different ontologies may be used for different contexts and mapped to each other in the underlying knowledge graph. Ontology elements are linked to by vocabularies and mapped to other data models and datasets to provide their meaning; and from Use Cases to provide their scope. These aspects are covered by those respective capabilities. Contribution to the Enterprise \u00b6 Ontologies are needed to truly understand what a given set of data really means and what can be inferred from it. For example, you cannot rely on the name of a column in a spreadsheet. A deceptively simple column name such as \"number of European customers\" leaves open the meaning of \"European\" and \"customer\" and timing (when does one start and stop being a customer?). And different sources could have different interpretations of that same name. The benefit is consistency, accuracy and the ability to make sound business decisions. Having the models themselves be resources that can be looked up means that all data is self-defining and carries its meaning with it. In an EKG there is no fixed set of ontologies so it can non-disruptively incorporate additional knowledge. Ontologies allow data to be understood independent of the format/technology and the vocabulary used in different communities, saving misunderstandings and battles over which word to use.

Technical implementation of data quality framework. Warn Work in progress What is key to operations? \u00b6 Knowing that the EKG team will more than likely be hands off from production, and even non production environments due to Sarbanes-Oxley makes day-to-day infrastructure management very challenging. In a regulated environment, software installations and hardware will be intentionally deployed by other Information Technology, IT, teams and drive their configuration and support. Infrastructure as code, which can be stored in source control, software allow teams to use markup such as YAML to manage configurations and orchestrate installation. A couple examples of open source software in this space include Ansible, Terraform, and Pulumi. EKG teams should try to leverage this to mitigate IT missteps that can and do occur while delegating the administration of the platform to other groups. Regardless of having the ability to treat infrastructure as code. It\u2019s imperative for the team to have access to an environment where they have privileges to run some of the infrastructure configuration manually and explore, as they may need to provide guidance to other IT teams such as a sandbox and/or lab. A sandbox is very useful to test and validate infrastructure in advance. Sandboxes, which could include a group of virtual machine instances in a lab should be as flexible as possible, and interim ideally. That said, because of the flexibility they offer there could be a tendency for them to become more permanent because of less restrictions. IT support groups will need very concise but relevant documentation to perform tasks, a step by step runbook. The sandboxes in the lab are viable way to create runbook documentation. Runbooks typically have specific configuration information, how to start and stopping software services, necessary permissions, troubleshooting tips, and other relevant server host information. Separate environments are typically defined and adhered to such as Development, User Acceptance Testing Production, Disaster Recovery, defined by IT. If you are doing machine learning, natural language processing, or anything which requires models , it may be imperative to have Production model training/development. This may seem counter intuitive to have a model training/development, but needed but may be challenging to justify as test data may not be representative due to redaction. Backups should be made both by disk image snapshots of the VMs, and serialized data exports from the software platform tools and utilities. Containerization, such as Docker, and container management, such as Kubernetes and Helm roles/playbooks, while pervasive may not be available. When not available numerous tool package managers such as pip, asdf, npm, brew, chocolatey, nixos, yum, apt are responsible for dependencies for underlying software components inevitably can fill the the gap but must be inventoried, understood, and dealt separately rather than just using as an opaque container provided. Package management can be categorized into operating system level, programming library, and application installation dependencies. This package management is often a time consuming, interwoven, tedious process, which should not to be under estimated for. Package managers can also be invoked from containers and infrastructure as code. \u2028 Typically in-house developed applications deployments are a push vs a pull, due to security requirements. Thus a DevOps pipeline incorporate Build from code, Archive artifacts, Scan for security issues, and Deploy to target server steps. A challenge is that custom applications use many libraries and packages, the application may expect to pull dependencies dynamically even at run time, in practice this may not be feasible on an air-gapped platform. Dependencies may need to be incorporated prior at build time and archived, and not dynamically at run-time depending on IT regulation and governance. When we are discussing operations, while important to the EKG team we typically are not discussing specific EKG roles of the platform with IT such as ontology versions. That said, we can discuss in terms they may understand such as ETL/ELT, data model management, and application performance vendor or developed in-house. It may be good to try to map terms the EKG is familiar with to IT terminology. Not everything can be mapped to IT terminology and but imperative. For example.Ensuring ontology namespace IRIs are allocated by DNS . An organization may have a preference for .net versus .com for example. That said, an ontologist may have no preference, unless it doesn\u2019t change. Any sort of artifact that expires such as certificates even DNS name allocations, should be managed by IT operations. These sort of infrastructure challenges may not even be visible or be on the agenda of the EKG team, but if not considered could cause outages while trying to rectify and determining responsibility. Folders need to be organized where data is staged and materialized, not in a haphazard manner, if IT has standards - follow them. Credentials should to be encrypted by a separate group and never given to a development team, if only for a temporary basis for troubleshooting and immediately changed after. You must have a dedicated IT support team to the EKG group, with appropriate access to perform administrative tasks, not necessarily root/admin access but with just the right amount of access to perform application management and/or operating system level changes if and only if the platform requires it. Release notes, platform, and other operational guidance should be published for the team to communicate with IT. It may also need to be restricted as some sensitive information could be maliciously used by sharing the configuration in a non-restricted manner. This information should be need to know only. Logging and system monitoring is also very important but will be covered in a subsequent section. Warn Work in progress Warn Work in progress.

Data Quality Implementation"},{"location":"pillar-dev/technology/technology-execution/data-quality-implementation/#what-is-key-to-operations","text":"Knowing that the EKG team will more than likely be hands off from production, and even non production environments due to Sarbanes-Oxley makes day-to-day infrastructure management very challenging. In a regulated environment, software installations and hardware will be intentionally deployed by other Information Technology, IT, teams and drive their configuration and support. Infrastructure as code, which can be stored in source control, software allow teams to use markup such as YAML to manage configurations and orchestrate installation. A couple examples of open source software in this space include Ansible, Terraform, and Pulumi. EKG teams should try to leverage this to mitigate IT missteps that can and do occur while delegating the administration of the platform to other groups. Regardless of having the ability to treat infrastructure as code. It\u2019s imperative for the team to have access to an environment where they have privileges to run some of the infrastructure configuration manually and explore, as they may need to provide guidance to other IT teams such as a sandbox and/or lab. A sandbox is very useful to test and validate infrastructure in advance. Sandboxes, which could include a group of virtual machine instances in a lab should be as flexible as possible, and interim ideally. That said, because of the flexibility they offer there could be a tendency for them to become more permanent because of less restrictions. IT support groups will need very concise but relevant documentation to perform tasks, a step by step runbook. The sandboxes in the lab are viable way to create runbook documentation. Runbooks typically have specific configuration information, how to start and stopping software services, necessary permissions, troubleshooting tips, and other relevant server host information. Separate environments are typically defined and adhered to such as Development, User Acceptance Testing Production, Disaster Recovery, defined by IT. If you are doing machine learning, natural language processing, or anything which requires models , it may be imperative to have Production model training/development. This may seem counter intuitive to have a model training/development, but needed but may be challenging to justify as test data may not be representative due to redaction. Backups should be made both by disk image snapshots of the VMs, and serialized data exports from the software platform tools and utilities. Containerization, such as Docker, and container management, such as Kubernetes and Helm roles/playbooks, while pervasive may not be available. When not available numerous tool package managers such as pip, asdf, npm, brew, chocolatey, nixos, yum, apt are responsible for dependencies for underlying software components inevitably can fill the the gap but must be inventoried, understood, and dealt separately rather than just using as an opaque container provided. Package management can be categorized into operating system level, programming library, and application installation dependencies. This package management is often a time consuming, interwoven, tedious process, which should not to be under estimated for. Package managers can also be invoked from containers and infrastructure as code. \u2028 Typically in-house developed applications deployments are a push vs a pull, due to security requirements. Thus a DevOps pipeline incorporate Build from code, Archive artifacts, Scan for security issues, and Deploy to target server steps. A challenge is that custom applications use many libraries and packages, the application may expect to pull dependencies dynamically even at run time, in practice this may not be feasible on an air-gapped platform. Dependencies may need to be incorporated prior at build time and archived, and not dynamically at run-time depending on IT regulation and governance. When we are discussing operations, while important to the EKG team we typically are not discussing specific EKG roles of the platform with IT such as ontology versions. That said, we can discuss in terms they may understand such as ETL/ELT, data model management, and application performance vendor or developed in-house. It may be good to try to map terms the EKG is familiar with to IT terminology. Not everything can be mapped to IT terminology and but imperative. For example.Ensuring ontology namespace IRIs are allocated by DNS . An organization may have a preference for .net versus .com for example. That said, an ontologist may have no preference, unless it doesn\u2019t change. Any sort of artifact that expires such as certificates even DNS name allocations, should be managed by IT operations. These sort of infrastructure challenges may not even be visible or be on the agenda of the EKG team, but if not considered could cause outages while trying to rectify and determining responsibility. Folders need to be organized where data is staged and materialized, not in a haphazard manner, if IT has standards - follow them. Credentials should to be encrypted by a separate group and never given to a development team, if only for a temporary basis for troubleshooting and immediately changed after. You must have a dedicated IT support team to the EKG group, with appropriate access to perform administrative tasks, not necessarily root/admin access but with just the right amount of access to perform application management and/or operating system level changes if and only if the platform requires it. Release notes, platform, and other operational guidance should be published for the team to communicate with IT. It may also need to be restricted as some sensitive information could be maliciously used by sharing the configuration in a non-restricted manner. This information should be need to know only. Logging and system monitoring is also very important but will be covered in a subsequent section. Warn Work in progress Warn Work in progress.
