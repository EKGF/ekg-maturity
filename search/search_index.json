Michael E. Porter defines strategy as:</p>  <p>Strategy is the creation of a unique valuable position; involving a different set of activities</p>  <p>Valuable positions emerge from three different sources. First, positioning can be based on producing a particular set of products or services. Second, positioning can also be achieved by targeting the needs of a particular customer segment. Third, the last basis for positioning is based on the way customers can be reached as the way to reach a particular segment might differ from other ones even though their needs are very similar. For example, customer could be geographically spread or could be served only through specific channels. Building a strategic position also involves trade-offs in terms of (1) image or reputation, (2) activities and resources, and (3) priorities.</p> <p>Even though these trade-offs might seem undesirable at first sight, they are necessary for a sustainable strategic position according to Porter. These trade-offs reduce the risk of imitation and straddling. The former occurs when a competitor repositions itself to obtain the valuable strategic position of another company. The latter is far more common and occurs when a straddler seeks to obtain the advantages of a valuable strategic position while maintaining its existing position. However, an imitator or straddler may encounter many problems when trying to obtain a strategic position different from the one it already has. For example, a premium retailer may encounter many problems while trying to position itself as a low-price retailer as both positions require different priorities, resources and activities. This transition may even jeopardize the retailer's current strategic position and confuse its consumers by showing them two incongruent images. Therefore, Porter also defines strategy as:</p>  <p>Strategy is making trade-offs in competing. The essence of strategy is choosing what not to do.</p>  <p>Positioning determines not only what activities a company will carry out and how it will set up individual activities but also how activities relate to one another. The latter characteristic is called fit and the most valuable fit is strategy-specific because it enhances a position\u2019s uniqueness and amplifies trade-offs. Creating a fit between activities that is difficult to imitate also creates a sustainable strategic position. Finally, Michael E. Porter also defines strategy as:</p>  <p>Strategy is creating fit among a company\u2019s activities. The success of a strategy depends on doing many things well---not just a few---and  integrating among them.</p>","location":"article/business-strategy/"},{"title":"Dimensions of Knowledge Risk Assessment","text":"","location":"article/dimensions-of-knowledge-risk-assessment/"},{"title":"Risk to be Measured","text":"<p>The FCC (USA Federal Communications Commission) has advised that  every business that uses the Internet is responsible for creating  a culture of security that will enhance business and consumer confidence.

An operating model describes how a company wants to thrive and grow.  By providing a more stable and actionable view of the company than strategy,  the operating model drives the design of the foundation for execution.</p>  <p>Defining an operating model in an organization is very important because it enables the adoption of different strategic initiatives as a foundation for execution. Such an operating model represents and reinforces the strategy to be supported. Therefore, the operating model---or the lack of it---has a profound impact on how a company implements business processes and IT.</p> <p>An operating model has two dimensions which are (1) business process standardization and (2) integration:</p> <ol> <li>According to Ross, Weil and Robertson (2006), standardization    of business processes can be defined as; \u201cdefining exactly how a process    will be executed regardless of who is performing the process or where it     is completed. Process standardization delivers efficiency and predictability    across the company\u201d    Business process standardization can lead to large increases in throughput    and efficiency.    However, it comes at a price since the more business processes are standardized,    the more difficult it is to tailor services and products for specific    customer needs hampering innovation and business agility in the process.</li> <li>Business process integration coordinates efforts and work     across organizations through data.    Sharing data can occur between processes to enable end-to-end    transaction processing, or across processes to allow the company     to present a single face to customers.    Some benefits of integration are increased efficiency, coordination,    transparency, and agility.     However, integration entails a large amount of effort such as in     end-to-end integration where companies need to develop standard     data definitions and formats that will be shared and used across different    business units and functions.</li> </ol> <p>Companies adopt an operating model at the enterprise level but could also  adopt different operating models at the division, business region, or other level. In order to define an operating model at any of these different levels, companies need to answer the following two questions (Ross, Weil and Robertson (2006)):</p> <ol> <li>To what extent is the successful completion of one business unit\u2019s    transactions dependent on the availability, accuracy, and timeliness    of other business unit\u2019s data?</li> <li>To what extent does the company benefit by having business units    run their operations in the same way?</li> </ol> <p>The first question determines integration requirements while the second one covers the standardization requirements of an organizations.

Therefore, these companies may benefit the most from enterprise-wide systems to support company standardization and integration requirements.</p> <p>Management in these companies is highly centralized and plays an important role in driving out inefficiencies to foster growth through economies of scale by introducing new products.

Each operating model entails its own opportunities for growth.</p> <p>The need to tightly integrate business processes make acquisitions and mergers---for both the buy-side as well as the sell-side---more challenging as disparate data definitions need to be reconciled. However, the tight process integration of the Coordination and Unification models offers opportunities of organic growth through expansion into new markets or extensions of current product lines.</p> <p>Process standardization, as in the Unification and Replication models, enables growth through a rip-an-replace approach to acquisitions. When an acquiring company wants to create a mirror image of itself out of an acquired company, it only has to replace the processes and systems of the acquired business with its own. However, both models do not offer much leverage when a company chooses to expand into operationally distinct lines of business as both models depend on leveraging already existing processes.</p> <p>The Diversification model imposes fewer constraints on the organic growth of individual business units and fewer limits for business acquisitions.

For instance, Diversification companies may benefit from allowing their own business units to adopt their own operating models as these business units are highly independent. An example of a Diversification company whose business units adopted different operating models is Johnson &amp; Johnson. J&amp;J\u2019s U.S. pharmaceutical group applies a Coordination operating model in which there is a single touchpoint with health-care practitioners while their subsidiary Janssen Pharmaceuticals implements a Replication operating model in Europe with highly standardized, low cost processes. This gives freedom to each business unit to implement a different operating model depending on its own objectives while maintaining a relatively simple operating model at a corporate level.</p> <p>An operating model gives a company better guidance for developing IT and business process capabilities. It also serves as a stable foundation for strategic endeavours such as mergers and acquisitions.</p> <p>This foundation enables IT to be more proactive in identifying possible strategic opportunities. In order to define an operating model, management needs to define the role of business process standardization and integration. This also requires management to identify the company\u2019s key business processes that create a sustainable competitive advantage for the company. As a result, an operating model offers a company the possibility to create and possess reusable capabilities for long-term growth. In this context, an operating model could be seen as the main driver of strategy at a corporate or business level. In addition, an operating model plays a major role in defining the required architecture, practices, management thinking, policies, and processes as they may be different for each operating model. In other words, an operating model could be a key driver in the design of separate organization units.</p>","location":"article/operating-model/#applying-the-operating-model-to-attain-growth"},{"title":"Value proposition of EKG","text":"<p>Antwerp, December 2021, Carlos Tubbax.</p> <p>Companies face increasingly difficult challenges due to the complexity of their business environments stemming from market disruptions, new regulations,  the COVID-19 pandemic or other large scale events.  In such a challenging business world, being able to have a clear oversight  of an organization as a whole has become more critical than ever to  assess risk exposure, to find supply chain bottlenecks,  to comply to regulations among other business requirements.  Therefore, connecting the dots spread inside and outside each company  is necessary for all these crucial tasks.  In this context, the word dots refers to data needed to carry out these  different tasks.</p> <p>However, connecting the dots is far easier said than done as these dots  are most often spread across a myriad of business silos that may not even  aware of each other\u2019s existence and in different formats that make the  task of integrating and harmonizing data across the enterprise overly complex.</p> <p>As a solution to this problem, the Semantic Web and its underlying standards were developed as an answer to integrate, identify, catalogue, harmonize  and assign meaning to individual pieces of data from different sources.  Enterprise Knowledge Graphs (EKGs) aim at doing that at an enterprise-wide  level by using Semantic Web standards and technologies.  Additionally, EKGs can boost other technologies such as machine learning  and blockchain by feeding them with high-quality and meaningful data.</p> <p>The purpose of this maturity model is to guide companies and other  organizations throughout the development of Enterprise Knowledge Graphs  as a tool to develop capabilities that they may consider vital for their  own businesses such as risk management or customer 360\u00b0 and for  which connecting the dots is necessary.  Since this journey will certainly require lots of time and effort,  this maturity model aims at providing a step-by-step rationale of  how companies can develop EKGs that serve their own business needs.  The maturity model will guide enterprises throughout its different maturity levels that will mark the progress of the Enterprise in developing EKG(s) for this kind of enterprise-wide use cases. In order to make the utility of Knowledge Graphs for enterprises clearer, this part will provide some examples of how knowledge graphs  could be used to tackle the aforementioned problems and to  connect the dots for some use cases.  However, the decision of which use cases need to be supported and  prioritized is up to each enterprise.  Therefore, the following examples are just mere illustrations of  what companies can do by connecting the dots.</p> <p>People using Amazon\u2019s Alexa, ordering food through Uber Eats or  booking a listing on Airbnb are using a knowledge graph even if  they are totally unaware of that.  Amazon, Alexa, Uber among other cutting-edge companies have been  using knowledge graph technology to disrupt entire sectors and  to create new value propositions to their customers.1 For example, Amazon uses a product graph to categorize products on its retail website and to make better product suggestions to  customers among other things.2 In that context, Knowledge Graphs fulfills the role of  disruption enabler.  In order to illustrate this, it will be discussed how Airbnb uses  a knowledge graph to enhance its customer experience by integrating and conducting computer reasoning on data coming from different data sources.  </p> <p>On the other hand, Enterprise Knowledge Graphs may also provide great value when being used to support the daily operations of  a business and, in that context, the enterprise is their end user.  Although there are fewer examples of knowledge graphs being used  in this context, Deloitte\u2019s white papers discusses how  knowledge graphs could be used in organizations to unravel  the intricacies of their own business processes, relationships, supply chains, etc. by the means provided by Enterprise Knowledge Graphs as a business supporting/enabling technology.</p>","location":"article/value-proposition-of-ekg/"},{"title":"Customer experience enhancement at Airbnb","text":"<p>In order to move towards its vision of becoming an end-to-end  travel platform, Airbnb needs to be able to provide customers  insights that help them decide when to travel, where to travel  and what to do in their trips.

Additionally, it is far simpler to connect data about a  certain object spread across different data sources with a  knowledge graph than it is with a relational database.  Another advantage of knowledge graphs compared to  relational databases is that new relationships between concepts  or objects can be added to a knowledge graph in a much more  flexible and simpler fashion.   For instance, knowledge graphs can link the concept surfing as  a sport to the concept surfing which Hawaii is known for.  So, if a customer asks Airbnb\u2019s website for surfing destinations,  Hawaii may appear on the query results.

It\u2019s up to the \"fixer\" (usually called \"developer\" in most git documentation on the Internet) to decide which tooling they use. One way to do this is to just use the Github website itself but you could also create a so-called \"clone\" of the git repository on your  local machine and use the standard git utility to create a commit or  use an advanced editor like Visual Studio Code that has built-in git and Markdown support. It goes too far to document all the various different ways to do this  in the context of this document. What\u2019s important to know is that, as a fixer, you should always include the issue number in the title of the commit.  For example, if you edit a content page and then commit that change,  you have to make sure that these two things are done before clicking  the \"Propose Changes\" button as shown in the figure above.</p> <p>Use a title for your commit that includes the issue number,  prefixed by <code>#</code>, for example, <code>#123</code> for issue 123.

Not everyone is up for that, \u201cexposing\u201d their  first draft changes to others, but it\u2019s generally seen as  good practice doing so.

Widespread digitalization over the last two decades has accelerated the scale, reach and impact of businesses in today\u2019s knowledge economy. Seven of the top ten firms globally by market capitalization at the  time of this writing ( Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, Facebook, Tencent, Alibaba), are representative of this characterization.

Prevalent characterization of some business models offers some clue:</p>  Embedded Finance  <p>The emphasis that convenience of financial products is increasingly determined by integrating them seamlessly into non-financial applications and processes. Embedded Finance offers a new, very large addressable market  opportunity worth over $7 trillion in ten years' time, twice the combined value of the world\u2019s top 30 banks today.</p>  Subscription Services  <p>The emphasis that experience of products and services is  increasingly determined not from broad contours of use over  time but by specific contexts of use at any given time. 78% of international adults in 2021 have subscription services (71% in 2018). And 75% believe that in the future, people will subscribe to  more services and own less physical \"stuff\".</p>  Platform Services  <p>The emphasis that utility of services is increasingly determined not from clarity of individual service but through convenience of search and similarity of use across a range  of related products and services.

Mechanisms such as Balanced Scorecards to their business performance, emphasising the causal chains coursing through organizational capability, operations and customer propositions, eventually landing into financial performance as an outcome. More recently, there has been an emphasis on key stakeholder metrics such as ESG adding further dimensions to responsible business performance.</p> <p>The paradigm of business performance has largely hinged on organizations directly influencing their customer engagements with their products and services. Indeed, the prevalent use of the term \"customer\" is ingrained as a counterpart to the organizations\u2019 products. Dramatic advances in the digital economy, especially in the area of mobile  and sensor technology over the last 15 years, have highlighted the  perception of value through insights into consumption/use. In other words, the presumed value in organizations\u2019 products and services is increasingly validated through actual insights into consumption/use by consumers.</p> <p>This shift in perspective of an organizations\u2019 products and services as patterns (based on insights) of consumer use is where movements such as design thinking}, customer journey maps etc are increasingly considered as important tools for developing and validating propositions. The \"aha\" and \"viola\" moments from such exercises require further translation into realizing the propositions, which is where practices around agility, DevOps etc. are increasingly mainstream.</p> <p>All these themes and mechanisms of strategy execution through communication, product/service propositions, development/deployment and its performance management largely depend on a human capital  based on participation, expertise and intuition. Organizations wishing to amplify their human capital face a few key  dichotomies to be addressed:</p>  Customer vs Consumer  <p>Mindset and capability shift from \"Customer market share\" to \"share of (end) consumer value\"</p>  Enterprise vs Ecosystem  <p>Mindset and capability shift from \u201cProprietary control of customer experiences\u201d to \u201copen collaboration on consumer experiences\u201d</p>  Human Machine Continuum  <p>Mindset shift from human-scaled to machine-scaled (intelligent and autonomous) business capability</p>   <p>Each of the above dichotomies highlights the limitations enterprises face today in extending business capability beyond their organizational boundaries, be it in sourcing information beyond their own channels or collaborating on shared experiences.</p> <p>Addressing these challenges requires enterprises to adopt an exploratory style in executing their strategy1 which specifically  focuses on sensing and understanding the consumer ecosystem better before  taking decisions and acting (to be aligned to hyper-personalization,  both in retail and business consumer scenarios)</p> <p>To put this \u201cExplorative Execution\u201d into perspective, a useful  mental model is SUDA (Sense, Understand, Decide, Act, a slight variant of John Boyd\u2019s OODA loop), specifically focused on responding/acting  in a dynamic evolving environment. The choice of the mental model is to bring out its contrast with the imperative style mental model of Plan, Do, Check, Act (PDCA), usually used for acting in an environment of more certainty and  predictability.</p>  SENSE  <p>Accessing actual contents of need and use by consumers easily overwhelms most organizations for a variety of reasons, chief amongst which is the  sheer volume of context-unique interactions which must be checked for   links to an organization\u2019s business interests and intents. Most of this is practiced subjectively and accorded to human expertise and intuition.</p>  UNDERSTAND  <p>Unlike the carefully curated lens of its products and services, inputs of interest for an organization are generally ambiguous  requiring significant efforts to disambiguate and synthesize. (John Boyd\u2019s Orientation isn\u2019t just a state you\u2019re in; it\u2019s a process.  You\u2019re always orienting.)</p>  DECIDE  <p>Disambiguated information still isn\u2019t directly actionable as there is a significant element of hypothesis embedded within.

Widespread digitalization over the last two decades has accelerated the scale, reach and impact of businesses in today\u2019s knowledge economy. Seven of the top ten firms globally by market capitalization at the  time of this writing ( Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, Facebook, Tencent, Alibaba), are representative of this characterization. This underscores the broad expectation that future competitiveness is increasingly focused on embedding and capitalizing knowledge in the  design, delivery and eventual effectiveness of products, services  and activities in business models of Enterprises.</p> <p>What does a knowledge-based differentiated focus in products and  services mean for enterprises? Prevalent characterization of some business models offers some clue:</p>  Embedded Finance  <p>The emphasis that convenience of financial products is increasingly determined by integrating them seamlessly into non-financial applications and processes. Embedded Finance offers a new, very large addressable market  opportunity worth over $7 trillion in ten years' time, twice the combined value of the world\u2019s top 30 banks today.</p>  Subscription Services  <p>The emphasis that experience of products and services is  increasingly determined not from broad contours of use over  time but by specific contexts of use at any given time. 78% of international adults in 2021 have subscription services (71% in 2018). And 75% believe that in the future, people will subscribe to  more services and own less physical \"stuff\".</p>  Platform Services  <p>The emphasis that utility of services is increasingly determined not from clarity of individual service but through convenience of search and similarity of use across a range  of related products and services.

Mechanisms such as Balanced Scorecards to their business performance, emphasising the causal chains coursing through organizational capability, operations and customer propositions, eventually landing into financial performance as an outcome. More recently, there has been an emphasis on key stakeholder metrics such as ESG adding further dimensions to responsible business performance.</p> <p>The paradigm of business performance has largely hinged on organizations directly influencing their customer engagements with their products and services. Indeed, the prevalent use of the term \"customer\" is ingrained as a counterpart to the organizations\u2019 products. Dramatic advances in the digital economy, especially in the area of mobile  and sensor technology over the last 15 years, have highlighted the  perception of value through insights into consumption/use. In other words, the presumed value in organizations\u2019 products and services is increasingly validated through actual insights into consumption/use by consumers.</p> <p>This shift in perspective of an organizations\u2019 products and services as patterns (based on insights) of consumer use is where movements such as design thinking}, customer journey maps etc are increasingly considered as important tools for developing and validating propositions. The \"aha\" and \"viola\" moments from such exercises require further translation into realizing the propositions, which is where practices around agility, DevOps etc. are increasingly mainstream.</p> <p>All these themes and mechanisms of strategy execution through communication, product/service propositions, development/deployment and its performance management largely depend on a human capital  based on participation, expertise and intuition. Organizations wishing to amplify their human capital face a few key  dichotomies to be addressed:</p>  Customer vs Consumer  <p>Mindset and capability shift from \"Customer market share\" to \"share of (end) consumer value\"</p>  Enterprise vs Ecosystem  <p>Mindset and capability shift from \u201cProprietary control of customer experiences\u201d to \u201copen collaboration on consumer experiences\u201d</p>  Human Machine Continuum  <p>Mindset shift from human-scaled to machine-scaled (intelligent and autonomous) business capability</p>   <p>Each of the above dichotomies highlights the limitations enterprises face today in extending business capability beyond their organizational boundaries, be it in sourcing information beyond their own channels or collaborating on shared experiences.</p> <p>Addressing these challenges requires enterprises to adopt an exploratory style in executing their strategy1 which specifically  focuses on sensing and understanding the consumer ecosystem better before  taking decisions and acting (to be aligned to hyper-personalization,  both in retail and business consumer scenarios)</p> <p>To put this \u201cExplorative Execution\u201d into perspective, a useful  mental model is SUDA (Sense, Understand, Decide, Act, a slight variant of John Boyd\u2019s OODA loop), specifically focused on responding/acting  in a dynamic evolving environment.

Focusing on the what rather than on the how often provides the right level of abstraction of complex ecosystems in a way that can be easily digested by business executives and planning teams.</p>   <p> In recent years, the word capability has steadily been drawing attention in the business world as a way to narrow the gap between business and IT. A capability is described by Ulrich and Rosen, (p.1, 2011) as:</p>  <p>A business capability, or simply a \u201ccapability,\u201d defines what a business does. It does not communicate or expose where, why, or how something is done---only what is done. Specifically, the business capability is \u201ca particular ability or capacity that a business may possess or exchange to achieve a specific purpose or outcome.</p>  <p>Understanding what a business does is at least as important as understanding how it does it. Focusing on the what rather than on the how often provides the right level of abstraction of complex ecosystems in a way that can be easily digested by business executives and planning teams. Dissecting a business as a set of basic capabilities allows one to view complex organizations and business environments in a wide range of different ways. Additionally, one could zoom in on lower levels of abstraction to reach higher levels of detail depending on the needs of the target audience.</p> <p>Consider the example of the high-level capability called customer 360\u00b0. This capability refers to having a complete picture of the customer and this is a capability many organizations may benefit from. A customer may be called a taxpayer in the context of a government institution, a patient in the context of a hospital and a student in the context of a university. Being able to manage different aspects of a customer might be imperative for many businesses depending on their business strategy. For instance, customer 360\u00b0 as a high-level capability could entail the customer trend analysis and customer management information capabilities as lower-level capabilities.</p> <p>In other words, this means that capabilities are concerns that could be refined into lower-level capabilities that in turn could be further refined. The advantage of functional decomposition in this hierarchical and modular way is that it increases the reusability of capabilities across business lines, enterprises or even industries. Additionally, decomposing capabilities in different levels of abstraction offers a better sense of how capabilities fit in on the overall view of the enterprise.</p> <p>Capabilities should follow certain principles as follows:</p> <ol> <li>Capabilities define what a business does and not how a business does it.    This implies that a capability does not refer to a process or value stream.</li> <li>Capabilities are nouns, not verbs.    To make the distinction between a capability and a process, capabilities should be named with nouns such as    customer management instead of a verb managing customers.</li> <li>Capabilities should be defined in business term and not in technical terms.    Executives and other business professionals should be able to clearly understand what a capability means    ---and take ownership of it---without being bothered with the technical details of the systems    that implement it.</li> <li>Capabilities should be stable (i.e. least volatile) as possible.    There is a fundamental set of high-level capabilities that are necessary to run a business regardless    of the sector of industry it is located in. Additionally, high-level capabilities may rarely change    within an organization unless there are significant changes to its business strategy or organization.</li> <li>Capabilities are not redundant.    Capabilities appear once and only once on a capability maps even though they are shared by more than division,    business line or business unit of an enterprise.</li> <li>There should only be one business capability map per business.    In order to bring transparency across the organization, there should be a single unified and harmonized    business capability map per business.    Therefore, business capabilities spread throughout different business units, divisions, department,    lines of business, etc should be only appear once in the business capability map.</li> <li>Capabilities map to---but are not the same as---business processes, business units,    Lines of Business (LOBs) and value streams.    There is rarely a one-to-one mapping between a business process, a business unit, an LOB or    a value stream, and a capability.    Therefore, mistaking a capability with one these other concepts may result in an overly complex overview of    things that are constantly repeated across the enterprise.    Additionally, we\u2019re trying to understand the what rather than the how and this would not be possible if    capabilities are mistaken with  process-related concepts.</li> <li>Automated capabilities are still business capabilities and not IT capabilities.    Capabilities are owned by the business as they are made by and for the business.    Therefore, a capability that has been automated with an IT system is not an IT capability.    Instead, it is nothing else than an automated business capability.</li> <li>Capabilities are the most valuable when incorporated in the overall pictures of a business\u2019 ecosystem.    While being useful in a stand-alone basis for discussion and planning, capabilities fulfil their biggest    potential by being combined into a larger business capability map that represents the business ecosystem    of an enterprise.</li> </ol>","location":"pillar/business/capability-area/business-enablers/capability/capability-map/"},{"title":"Dimensions","text":"<p>Warn</p> <p>Work in progress, this is just the results of an initial brainstorm session, needs to be worked out</p>  <ol> <li>Capability Map Coverage: does your capability map cover your    whole business?

Measuring the ROI of investment projects can be very   difficult as the results might be spread across a myriad of   different LOBs or business units.   Instead of reconciling results from all these different places,   one could merely look at the resources being allocated at a   certain capability and this may allow business executives to   have better estimates of the impact of their investments on the   enterprise as a whole.</li> <li>Capabilities serve as a baseline for strategic planning, change management and impact analysis.   By shifting the focus from business units, lines of business,   IT systems and business processes to business capabilities,   one is able to increase the traceability of strategic decisions   into the daily operations and the business performance of the   enterprise as a whole.

Depending on an enterprise's Business Models, multiple operating models, at corporate and unit/divisional levels, could co-exist, in pursuit of the business strategy.</p> <p>In order to define an operating model at any of these different levels, Enterprises need to answer the following two questions:</p> <ol> <li>To what extent is the successful completion of one business unit\u2019s operations/transactions dependent on the    availability, accuracy, and timeliness of other business unit\u2019s information?</li> <li>To what extent does the enterprise benefit by having business units run their operations in the same way?</li> </ol> <p>The first question determines integration requirements while the second one covers the standardization requirements of an Enterprise.</p>  <p>Note</p> <p>80% of CEOs in one study claim to have transformations in place to make their businesses more digital; 87% expect to see a change in their operating models within three years.</p>  <p>In today's modern dynamic economic environment,  Enterprises have to contend with a variety of choices in the selection, ongoing evaluation and transformation of their operating models. Such choices are necessitated by a fast-changing competitive landscape and the accompanying need to constantly align the workforce capacity and capabilities to business tactics.

Change can be managed for any aspect of the business to include: geographic and facility footprint, market expansion, product development, business organization and staffing, new sales channels, process improvement, technology change, compliance to changes in regulations, and more.</p>   <p> Change is happening everywhere in organizations. The digitalization of everything (IoT, edge computing, digital transform) has created a fluid context for change, and the need to decentralize  decision-making to keep pace with exponential change and complexity requires non-linear thinking, planning, and execution.</p> <p>The current approaches for change management are usually built  on linear models which do not scale nor can they collate the facets of data --- let alone semantic perspectives ---,  that are overwhelming decision makers.</p>  <p>Jeffrey Wallk</p> <p>Ask not what Change Management can do for EKG, rather ask what EKG can do for Change Management</p>  <p>EKGs are the only way to build a scalable framework of understanding  about change and capture relevant patterns to guide option analysis  and impact analysis.

Partners will need to exchange information within N-lines of business and  N-shared activities.  Data integration must support these activities to connect data silos.</p> <p>Each lines of business can interchange data with concepts from ontologies  for shared activities and transactions.</p> <p>External data can also be interchanged with the enterprise using similar  concepts from ontologies with vendors, channels, and customers.</p> <p>Enterprise Knowledge Graphs when most mature fully implement a unity  of heterogeneous sources.  An evolving ontology drives data, information, knowledge, wisdom,  and in turn is formed in that order.  Graphs provide an operational structure to allow for chaining and  integrating data to create information/data integration via linking data throughout.</p> <p>RDF graphs are serializable by materialized data represented in the  form of triples and/or quads.  Direct import queries enables data to be integrated into and within a knowledge graph.</p> <p>Extract, transform, load processes are necessary.  Often these processes are abbreviated as ETL or ELT since the  mapping/transform may occur once after a load process is performed.</p> <p>RDF mapping language, RML, is a generalized source mapping language for  RDF to facilitate data integration from non-RDF sources.  Examples of RML sources include JSON,CSV, TSV, XML. R2RML is a subset of RML,  designed for integration of data from relational sources leveraging JDBC.</p> <p>CoNLL is a standard within NLP, Natural Language Processing, implemented  in CSV/TSV. CoNLL can be stored using the expressiveness of RDF using  CoNLL-RDF and converted back to CSV/TSV.</p> <p>Data when materialized should be stored in various RDF file serialization formats  such as: RDF/XML, JSON-LD, Turtle/TTL, NQUADS, NTriples, TriG, Trix, and n3.  The tools used in the ETL/ELT process should support manipulating data in these  common standardized knowledge graph formats.</p> <p>ETL/ELT needs to orchestrated once of any scale with data pipelines and  scheduling software.The simplest example would be using scheduling software  with batch scripts, more elaborate open source examples would be using a  Dev/MLOps framework.

In a regulated environment, software installations and hardware will be intentionally deployed by other Information Technology, IT, teams and drive their configuration and support.</p> <p>Infrastructure as code, which can be stored in source control, software allow teams to use markup such as YAML to manage configurations and orchestrate installation. A couple examples of open source software in this space include Ansible, Terraform, and Pulumi. EKG teams should try to leverage this to mitigate IT missteps that can and do occur while delegating the administration of the platform to other groups.</p> <p>Regardless of having the ability to treat infrastructure as code. It\u2019s imperative for the team to have access to an environment where they have privileges to run some of the infrastructure configuration manually and explore, as they may need to provide guidance to other IT teams such as a sandbox and/or lab. A sandbox is very useful to test and validate infrastructure in advance.</p> <p>Sandboxes, which could include a group of virtual machine instances in a lab should be as flexible as possible, and interim ideally. That said, because of the flexibility they offer there could be a tendency for them to become more permanent because of less restrictions. IT support groups will need very concise but relevant documentation to perform tasks, a step by step runbook. The sandboxes in the lab are viable way to create runbook documentation.</p> <p>Runbooks typically have specific configuration information, how to start and stopping software services, necessary permissions, troubleshooting tips, and other relevant server host information.</p> <p>Separate environments are typically defined and adhered to such as Development, User Acceptance Testing Production, Disaster Recovery, defined by IT.  If you are doing machine learning, natural language processing, or anything which requires models , it may be imperative to have Production model training/development. This may seem counter intuitive to have a model training/development, but needed but may be challenging to justify as test data may not be representative due to redaction. </p> <p>Backups should be made both by disk image snapshots of the VMs, and serialized data exports from the software platform tools and utilities.</p> <p>Containerization, such as Docker, and container management, such as Kubernetes and Helm roles/playbooks, while pervasive may not be available. </p> <p>When not available numerous tool package managers such as pip, asdf, npm, brew, chocolatey, nixos, yum, apt are responsible for dependencies for underlying software components inevitably can fill the the gap but must be inventoried, understood, and dealt separately rather than just using as an opaque container provided. Package management can be categorized into operating system level, programming library, and application installation dependencies. This package management is often a time consuming, interwoven, tedious process, which should not to be under estimated for. Package managers can also be invoked from containers and infrastructure as code. \u2028    Typically in-house developed applications deployments are a push vs a pull, due to security requirements. Thus a DevOps pipeline incorporate Build from code, Archive artifacts, Scan for security issues, and Deploy to target server steps. A challenge is that custom applications use many libraries and packages, the application may expect to pull dependencies dynamically even at run time, in practice this may not be feasible on an air-gapped platform.  Dependencies may need to be incorporated prior at build time and archived, and not dynamically at run-time depending on IT regulation and governance.</p> <p>When we are discussing operations, while important to the EKG team we typically are not discussing specific EKG roles of the platform with IT such as ontology versions. That said, we can discuss in terms they may understand such as ETL/ELT, data model management, and application performance vendor or developed in-house. It may be good to try to map terms the EKG is familiar with to IT terminology.</p> <p>Not everything can be mapped to IT terminology and but imperative. For example.Ensuring ontology namespace IRIs are allocated by DNS .  An organization may have a preference for .net versus .com for example. That said, an ontologist may have no preference, unless it doesn\u2019t change.</p> <p>Any sort of artifact that expires such as certificates even DNS name allocations, should be managed by IT operations. These sort of infrastructure challenges may not even be visible or be on the agenda of the EKG team, but if not considered could cause outages while trying to rectify and determining responsibility.</p> <p>Folders need to be organized where data is staged and materialized, not in a haphazard manner, if IT has standards - follow them.</p> <p>Credentials should to be encrypted by a separate group and never given to a development team, if only for a temporary basis for troubleshooting and immediately changed after.</p> <p>You must have a dedicated IT support team to the EKG group, with appropriate access to perform administrative tasks, not necessarily root/admin access but with just the right amount of access to perform application management and/or operating system level changes if and only if the platform requires it.</p> <p>Release notes, platform, and other operational guidance should be published for the team to communicate with IT. It may also need to be restricted as some sensitive information could be maliciously used by sharing the configuration in a non-restricted manner.
