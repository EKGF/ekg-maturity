Michael E. Porter defines strategy as:</p> <p>Strategy is the creation of a unique valuable position; involving a different set of activities</p> <p>Valuable positions emerge from three different sources. First, positioning can be based on producing a particular set of products or services. Second, positioning can also be achieved by targeting the needs of a particular customer segment. Third, the last basis for positioning is based on the way customers can be reached as the way to reach a particular segment might differ from other ones even though their needs are very similar. For example, customer could be geographically spread or could be served only through specific channels. Building a strategic position also involves trade-offs in terms of (1) image or reputation, (2) activities and resources, and (3) priorities.</p> <p>Even though these trade-offs might seem undesirable at first sight, they are necessary for a sustainable strategic position according to Porter. These trade-offs reduce the risk of imitation and straddling. The former occurs when a competitor repositions itself to obtain the valuable strategic position of another company. The latter is far more common and occurs when a straddler seeks to obtain the advantages of a valuable strategic position while maintaining its existing position. However, an imitator or straddler may encounter many problems when trying to obtain a strategic position different from the one it already has. For example, a premium retailer may encounter many problems while trying to position itself as a low-price retailer as both positions require different priorities, resources and activities. This transition may even jeopardize the retailer's current strategic position and confuse its consumers by showing them two incongruent images. Therefore, Porter also defines strategy as:</p> <p>Strategy is making trade-offs in competing. The essence of strategy is choosing what not to do.</p> <p>Positioning determines not only what activities a company will carry out and how it will set up individual activities but also how activities relate to one another. The latter characteristic is called fit and the most valuable fit is strategy-specific because it enhances a position\u2019s uniqueness and amplifies trade-offs. Creating a fit between activities that is difficult to imitate also creates a sustainable strategic position. Finally, Michael E. Porter also defines strategy as:</p> <p>Strategy is creating fit among a company\u2019s activities. The success of a strategy depends on doing many things well---not just a few---and  integrating among them.</p>"}, {"location": "article/dimensions-of-knowledge-risk-assessment/", "title": "Dimensions of Knowledge Risk Assessment", "text": ""}, {"location": "article/dimensions-of-knowledge-risk-assessment/#risk-to-be-measured", "title": "Risk to be Measured", "text": "<p>The FCC (USA Federal Communications Commission) has advised that  every business that uses the Internet is responsible for creating  a culture of security that will enhance business and consumer confidence.

An operating model describes how a company wants to thrive and grow.  By providing a more stable and actionable view of the company than strategy,  the operating model drives the design of the foundation for execution.</p> <p>Defining an operating model in an organization is very important because it enables the adoption of different strategic initiatives as a foundation for execution. Such an operating model represents and reinforces the strategy to be supported. Therefore, the operating model---or the lack of it---has a profound impact on how a company implements business processes and IT.</p> <p>An operating model has two dimensions which are (1) business process standardization and (2) integration:</p> <ol> <li>According to Ross, Weil and Robertson (2006), standardization    of business processes can be defined as; \u201cdefining exactly how a process    will be executed regardless of who is performing the process or where it     is completed. Process standardization delivers efficiency and predictability    across the company\u201d    Business process standardization can lead to large increases in throughput    and efficiency.    However, it comes at a price since the more business processes are standardized,    the more difficult it is to tailor services and products for specific    customer needs hampering innovation and business agility in the process.</li> <li>Business process integration coordinates efforts and work     across organizations through data.    Sharing data can occur between processes to enable end-to-end    transaction processing, or across processes to allow the company     to present a single face to customers.    Some benefits of integration are increased efficiency, coordination,    transparency, and agility.     However, integration entails a large amount of effort such as in     end-to-end integration where companies need to develop standard     data definitions and formats that will be shared and used across different    business units and functions.</li> </ol> <p>Companies adopt an operating model at the enterprise level but could also  adopt different operating models at the division, business region, or other level. In order to define an operating model at any of these different levels, companies need to answer the following two questions (Ross, Weil and Robertson (2006)):</p> <ol> <li>To what extent is the successful completion of one business unit\u2019s    transactions dependent on the availability, accuracy, and timeliness    of other business unit\u2019s data?</li> <li>To what extent does the company benefit by having business units    run their operations in the same way?</li> </ol> <p>The first question determines integration requirements while the second one covers the standardization requirements of an organizations.

Therefore, these companies may benefit the most from enterprise-wide systems to support company standardization and integration requirements.</p> <p>Management in these companies is highly centralized and plays an important role in driving out inefficiencies to foster growth through economies of scale by introducing new products.

However, the tight process integration of the Coordination and Unification models offers opportunities of organic growth through expansion into new markets or extensions of current product lines.</p> <p>Process standardization, as in the Unification and Replication models, enables growth through a rip-an-replace approach to acquisitions. When an acquiring company wants to create a mirror image of itself out of an acquired company, it only has to replace the processes and systems of the acquired business with its own. However, both models do not offer much leverage when a company chooses to expand into operationally distinct lines of business as both models depend on leveraging already existing processes.</p> <p>The Diversification model imposes fewer constraints on the organic growth of individual business units and fewer limits for business acquisitions.

For instance, Diversification companies may benefit from allowing their own business units to adopt their own operating models as these business units are highly independent. An example of a Diversification company whose business units adopted different operating models is Johnson &amp; Johnson. J&amp;J\u2019s U.S. pharmaceutical group applies a Coordination operating model in which there is a single touchpoint with health-care practitioners while their subsidiary Janssen Pharmaceuticals implements a Replication operating model in Europe with highly standardized, low cost processes. This gives freedom to each business unit to implement a different operating model depending on its own objectives while maintaining a relatively simple operating model at a corporate level.</p> <p>An operating model gives a company better guidance for developing IT and business process capabilities. It also serves as a stable foundation for strategic endeavours such as mergers and acquisitions.</p> <p>This foundation enables IT to be more proactive in identifying possible strategic opportunities. In order to define an operating model, management needs to define the role of business process standardization and integration. This also requires management to identify the company\u2019s key business processes that create a sustainable competitive advantage for the company. As a result, an operating model offers a company the possibility to create and possess reusable capabilities for long-term growth. In this context, an operating model could be seen as the main driver of strategy at a corporate or business level. In addition, an operating model plays a major role in defining the required architecture, practices, management thinking, policies, and processes as they may be different for each operating model. In other words, an operating model could be a key driver in the design of separate organization units.</p>"}, {"location": "article/value-proposition-of-ekg/", "title": "The value proposition of EKG", "text": "<p>Antwerp, December 2021, Carlos Tubbax.</p>"}, {"location": "article/value-proposition-of-ekg/#the-value-proposition-of-ekg", "title": "The value proposition of EKG", "text": "<p>Companies face increasingly difficult challenges due to the complexity of their business environments stemming from market disruptions, new regulations,  the COVID-19 pandemic or other large scale events.  In such a challenging business world, being able to have a clear oversight  of an organization as a whole has become more critical than ever to  assess risk exposure, to find supply chain bottlenecks,  to comply to regulations among other business requirements.  Therefore, connecting the dots spread inside and outside each company  is necessary for all these crucial tasks.  In this context, the word dots refers to data needed to carry out these  different tasks.</p> <p>However, connecting the dots is far easier said than done as these dots  are most often spread across a myriad of business silos that may not even  aware of each other\u2019s existence and in different formats that make the  task of integrating and harmonizing data across the enterprise overly complex.</p> <p>As a solution to this problem, the Semantic Web and its underlying standards were developed as an answer to integrate, identify, catalogue, harmonize  and assign meaning to individual pieces of data from different sources.  Enterprise Knowledge Graphs (EKGs) aim at doing that at an enterprise-wide  level by using Semantic Web standards and technologies.  Additionally, EKGs can boost other technologies such as machine learning  and blockchain by feeding them with high-quality and meaningful data.</p> <p>The purpose of this maturity model is to guide companies and other  organizations throughout the development of Enterprise Knowledge Graphs  as a tool to develop capabilities that they may consider vital for their  own businesses such as risk management or customer 360\u00b0 and for  which connecting the dots is necessary.  Since this journey will certainly require lots of time and effort,  this maturity model aims at providing a step-by-step rationale of  how companies can develop EKGs that serve their own business needs.  The maturity model will guide enterprises throughout its different maturity levels that will mark the progress of the Enterprise in developing EKG(s) for this kind of enterprise-wide use cases. In order to make the utility of Knowledge Graphs for enterprises clearer, this part will provide some examples of how knowledge graphs  could be used to tackle the aforementioned problems and to  connect the dots for some use cases.  However, the decision of which use cases need to be supported and  prioritized is up to each enterprise.  Therefore, the following examples are just mere illustrations of  what companies can do by connecting the dots.</p> <p>People using Amazon\u2019s Alexa, ordering food through Uber Eats or  booking a listing on Airbnb are using a knowledge graph even if  they are totally unaware of that.  Amazon, Alexa, Uber among other cutting-edge companies have been  using knowledge graph technology to disrupt entire sectors and  to create new value propositions to their customers.<sup>1</sup> For example, Amazon uses a product graph to categorize products on its retail website and to make better product suggestions to  customers among other things.<sup>2</sup> In that context, Knowledge Graphs fulfills the role of  disruption enabler.  In order to illustrate this, it will be discussed how Airbnb uses  a knowledge graph to enhance its customer experience by integrating and conducting computer reasoning on data coming from different data sources.  </p> <p>On the other hand, Enterprise Knowledge Graphs may also provide great value when being used to support the daily operations of  a business and, in that context, the enterprise is their end user.  Although there are fewer examples of knowledge graphs being used  in this context, Deloitte\u2019s white papers discusses how  knowledge graphs could be used in organizations to unravel  the intricacies of their own business processes, relationships, supply chains, etc. by the means provided by Enterprise Knowledge Graphs as a business supporting/enabling technology.</p>"}, {"location": "article/value-proposition-of-ekg/#customer-experience-enhancement-at-airbnb", "title": "Customer experience enhancement at Airbnb", "text": "<p>In order to move towards its vision of becoming an end-to-end  travel platform, Airbnb needs to be able to provide customers  insights that help them decide when to travel, where to travel  and what to do in their trips.

Additionally, it is far simpler to connect data about a  certain object spread across different data sources with a  knowledge graph than it is with a relational database.  Another advantage of knowledge graphs compared to  relational databases is that new relationships between concepts  or objects can be added to a knowledge graph in a much more  flexible and simpler fashion.   For instance, knowledge graphs can link the concept surfing as  a sport to the concept surfing which Hawaii is known for.  So, if a customer asks Airbnb\u2019s website for surfing destinations,  Hawaii may appear on the query results.

It\u2019s up to the \"fixer\" (usually called \"developer\" in most git documentation on the Internet) to decide which tooling they use. One way to do this is to just use the Github website itself but you could also create a so-called \"clone\" of the git repository on your  local machine and use the standard git utility to create a commit or  use an advanced editor like Visual Studio Code that has built-in git and Markdown support. It goes too far to document all the various different ways to do this  in the context of this document. What\u2019s important to know is that, as a fixer, you should always include the issue number in the title of the commit.  For example, if you edit a content page and then commit that change,  you have to make sure that these two things are done before clicking  the \"Propose Changes\" button as shown in the figure above.</p> <p>Use a title for your commit that includes the issue number,  prefixed by <code>#</code>, for example, <code>#123</code> for issue 123. Use a branch name that includes the issue number (no hash as a prefix).</p> <p>The <code>#123</code> in the title will trigger GitHub to move the corresponding issue from the \"To Do\" column to the \"In Progress\" column. Do not use <code>Fixed #123</code> or <code>Close #123</code> because that  will actually close the issue.</p> <p>Once you have done your first commit to a given branch, you\u2019re ready to create a PR.  Many people wait with creating a PR until their last commit is pushed (one issue can involve many commits involving many files, but they all  go to the same branch) but we recommend creating your PR as soon as possible,  after the first commit, because that gives everyone an easier insight  in the progress. Not everyone is up for that, \u201cexposing\u201d their  first draft changes to others, but it\u2019s generally seen as  good practice doing so.

Focusing on the what rather than on the how often provides the right level of abstraction of complex ecosystems in a way that can be easily digested by business executives and planning teams.</p> <p> In recent years, the word capability has steadily been drawing attention in the business world as a way to narrow the gap between business and IT. A capability is described by Ulrich and Rosen, (p.1, 2011) as:</p> <p>A business capability, or simply a \u201ccapability,\u201d defines what a business does. It does not communicate or expose where, why, or how something is done---only what is done. Specifically, the business capability is \u201ca particular ability or capacity that a business may possess or exchange to achieve a specific purpose or outcome.</p> <p>Understanding what a business does is at least as important as understanding how it does it. Focusing on the what rather than on the how often provides the right level of abstraction of complex ecosystems in a way that can be easily digested by business executives and planning teams. Dissecting a business as a set of basic capabilities allows one to view complex organizations and business environments in a wide range of different ways. Additionally, one could zoom in on lower levels of abstraction to reach higher levels of detail depending on the needs of the target audience.</p> <p>Consider the example of the high-level capability called customer 360\u00b0. This capability refers to having a complete picture of the customer and this is a capability many organizations may benefit from. A customer may be called a taxpayer in the context of a government institution, a patient in the context of a hospital and a student in the context of a university. Being able to manage different aspects of a customer might be imperative for many businesses depending on their business strategy. For instance, customer 360\u00b0 as a high-level capability could entail the customer trend analysis and customer management information capabilities as lower-level capabilities.</p> <p>In other words, this means that capabilities are concerns that could be refined into lower-level capabilities that in turn could be further refined. The advantage of functional decomposition in this hierarchical and modular way is that it increases the reusability of capabilities across business lines, enterprises or even industries. Additionally, decomposing capabilities in different levels of abstraction offers a better sense of how capabilities fit in on the overall view of the enterprise.</p> <p>Capabilities should follow certain principles as follows:</p> <ol> <li>Capabilities define what a business does and not how a business does it.    This implies that a capability does not refer to a process or value stream.</li> <li>Capabilities are nouns, not verbs.    To make the distinction between a capability and a process, capabilities should be named with nouns such as    customer management instead of a verb managing customers.</li> <li>Capabilities should be defined in business term and not in technical terms.    Executives and other business professionals should be able to clearly understand what a capability means    ---and take ownership of it---without being bothered with the technical details of the systems    that implement it.</li> <li>Capabilities should be stable (i.e. least volatile) as possible.    There is a fundamental set of high-level capabilities that are necessary to run a business regardless    of the sector of industry it is located in. Additionally, high-level capabilities may rarely change    within an organization unless there are significant changes to its business strategy or organization.</li> <li>Capabilities are not redundant.    Capabilities appear once and only once on a capability maps even though they are shared by more than division,    business line or business unit of an enterprise.</li> <li>There should only be one business capability map per business.    In order to bring transparency across the organization, there should be a single unified and harmonized    business capability map per business.    Therefore, business capabilities spread throughout different business units, divisions, department,    lines of business, etc should be only appear once in the business capability map.</li> <li>Capabilities map to---but are not the same as---business processes, business units,    Lines of Business (LOBs) and value streams.    There is rarely a one-to-one mapping between a business process, a business unit, an LOB or    a value stream, and a capability.    Therefore, mistaking a capability with one these other concepts may result in an overly complex overview of    things that are constantly repeated across the enterprise.    Additionally, we\u2019re trying to understand the what rather than the how and this would not be possible if    capabilities are mistaken with  process-related concepts.</li> <li>Automated capabilities are still business capabilities and not IT capabilities.    Capabilities are owned by the business as they are made by and for the business.    Therefore, a capability that has been automated with an IT system is not an IT capability.    Instead, it is nothing else than an automated business capability.</li> <li>Capabilities are the most valuable when incorporated in the overall pictures of a business\u2019 ecosystem.    While being useful in a stand-alone basis for discussion and planning, capabilities fulfil their biggest    potential by being combined into a larger business capability map that represents the business ecosystem    of an enterprise.</li> </ol> <p> Here is how the maturity levels of developing a capability map with an Enterprise Knowledge Graph (EKG) might progress:</p> <ol> <li> <p>EKG initiation: At this stage, the organization has just begun using an EKG to develop a capability map. The EKG may be used to store and manage data on the organization's capabilities, but it is not yet fully integrated into the organization's processes and systems.</p> </li> <li> <p>Extensible platform: At this stage, the organization has made significant progress in integrating the EKG into its processes and systems, and is using it to manage and update the capability map on an ongoing basis. The EKG has become an important tool for storing and organizing data on the organization's capabilities, and is being used to inform decision-making and strategic planning.</p> </li> <li> <p>Enterprise ready: At this stage, the EKG is a fully integrated and essential part of the organization's operations. It is being used to manage and update the capability map in real-time, and is providing valuable insights and information to help the organization make informed decisions.</p> </li> <li> <p>Strategic asset: At this stage, the EKG is seen as a strategic asset by the organization, and is being used to drive innovation and competitive advantage. It is being used to identify new opportunities and areas for growth, and to develop strategies to build and strengthen the organization's capabilities.</p> </li> <li> <p>Operational ecosystem: At this final stage, the EKG has become a key part of the organization's operational ecosystem, seamlessly integrating with other systems and processes to support the organization's operations and decision-making. The capability map is an integral part of this ecosystem, providing a clear and comprehensive view of the organization's capabilities and how they align with its goals and objectives.</p> </li> </ol> <p> Without an Enterprise Knowledge Graph (EKG), the development of a capability map would likely involve manually gathering data on the capabilities that are important to your organization. This could involve reviewing internal documents, conducting market research, and seeking input from experts within the organization.</p> <p>Once the data has been collected, you would need to manually organize and structure it in a way that allows you to create a visual representation of your organization's capabilities. This could be in the form of a diagram, chart, or other visual tool.</p> <p>Without the EKG, you would also need to find a way to store and manage the data that you have collected. This could involve creating and maintaining manual records, or using a separate database or spreadsheet tool.</p> <p>Finally, you would need to find a way to link the capabilities on the map to related information and resources, such as training materials, best practices, and case studies. This could involve manually searching for and compiling this information, or relying on other tools or systems to help you access and organize it.</p> <p>Overall, the development of a capability map without an EKG would likely be more time-consuming and labor-intensive, as it would involve manually gathering and organizing data, and finding ways to access and link related information and resources. Moreover, certain capabilities may not be able to be implemented with other technologies but EKG.</p> <p>Warn</p> <p>Work in progress, describe how this capability is possibly being delivered today in a non-EKG context and optionally what the issues are that EKG could or should improve</p> <p> A capability map is a visual representation of the capabilities of an organization or business unit.

The focus is on understanding the potential benefits and limitations of using a knowledge graph, and on developing a basic understanding of how to create and maintain a knowledge graph. This might involve conducting research and pilot projects to test the feasibility and effectiveness of using a knowledge graph.</p> </li> <li> <p>Extensible Platform: At this stage, the organization has implemented an enterprise knowledge graph and is using it to represent key components of its supply chain, such as suppliers, customers, and products. The focus is on expanding the scope and complexity of the knowledge graph, and on developing the skills and capabilities needed to maintain and update the graph as the supply chain evolves. This might involve integrating the knowledge graph with other systems and processes, and training employees on how to use the graph.</p> </li> <li> <p>Enterprise Ready: At this stage, the enterprise knowledge graph is being used to represent the full scope of the organization's supply chain and is integrated with other systems and processes. The focus is on optimizing the use of the knowledge graph and on developing advanced skills and capabilities in using the graph to support decision-making and supply chain management. This might involve implementing advanced analytics and machine learning algorithms to extract insights from the knowledge graph, and using the graph to support real-time decision-making.</p> </li> <li> <p>Strategic Asset: At this stage, the enterprise knowledge graph has become a key strategic asset for the organization, and is being used to drive innovation and differentiation in the supply chain. The focus is on leveraging the knowledge graph to support business growth and to create new value for customers. This might involve using the knowledge graph to develop new products and services, or to differentiate the organization's offerings from those of its competitors.</p> </li> <li> <p>Operational Ecosystem: At this stage, the enterprise knowledge graph has become an integral part of the organization's operational ecosystem and is being used to support a wide range of supply chain functions. The focus is on continuously improving the use of the knowledge graph to support the organization's goals and objectives. This might involve using the knowledge graph to support automation and digital transformation, or to enable real-time monitoring and response to supply chain disruptions.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Warn</p> <p>Work in progress, describe the 5 maturity levels of this capability</p> <p> Without an enterprise knowledge graph, supply chain management would likely involve the use of more traditional methods for storing and organizing information about the supply chain. This might include the use of spreadsheets, databases, or other types of data management systems.</p> <p>Without the centralized and organized structure of an enterprise knowledge graph, it may be more difficult for an organization to get a comprehensive and up-to-date understanding of its supply chain operations. This could lead to inefficiencies and delays in decision-making, as well as increased risk of disruptions in the supply chain.</p> <p>In addition, without an enterprise knowledge graph, it may be more challenging for an organization to facilitate collaboration and communication with its supply chain partners. This could lead to a lack of coordination and visibility, which can lead to additional challenges in managing the supply chain effectively.</p> <p>Overall, without an enterprise knowledge graph, supply chain management may be less efficient and more prone to disruptions, which could result in increased costs and other challenges for the organization.</p> <p>Warn</p> <p>Work in progress, describe how this capability is possibly being delivered today in a non-EKG context and optionally what the issues are that EKG could or should improve</p> <p> An enterprise knowledge graph is a type of database that stores and organizes information about an organization's various entities, such as products, people, customers, suppliers, and logistics assets, as well as the relationships between these entities. In a supply chain management context, an enterprise knowledge graph can be used to capture and organize information about the various components of the supply chain, including suppliers, manufacturers, warehouses, distribution centers, and retailers.</p> <p>By using an enterprise knowledge graph to manage supply chain information, an organization can gain a more comprehensive and up-to-date understanding of its supply chain operations. This can enable the organization to make more informed and efficient decisions about managing its resources, such as identifying bottlenecks in the supply chain, optimizing inventory levels, and improving delivery times.</p> <p>In addition, an enterprise knowledge graph can be used to facilitate collaboration and communication between different parties in the supply chain. For example, an enterprise knowledge graph could be used to share real-time updates about inventory levels, delivery schedules, and other supply chain-related information with suppliers, manufacturers, and other partners. This can help to improve coordination and reduce the risk of disruptions in the supply chain.</p> <p>Overall, the use of an enterprise knowledge graph can help organizations to better manage their supply chains, improve efficiency, and reduce costs.</p> <p>Warn</p> <p>Work in progress, describe how this capability would be delivered or supported using an EKG approach, making the link to the \"how\" i.e. the EKG/Method.</p> <p> There are many different use cases for supply chain management, as it is a critical component of businesses in a wide range of industries. Some common use cases for supply chain management include:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Sourcing raw materials: In many industries, organizations rely on a network of suppliers to provide the raw materials needed to produce their products. Supply chain management can help organizations to optimize the sourcing of raw materials by identifying reliable suppliers, negotiating favorable terms, and managing the flow of materials from supplier to production facility.</p> </li> <li> <p>Managing inventory: Effective inventory management is critical for ensuring that products are available when needed to meet customer demand. Supply chain management can help organizations to optimize their inventory levels by forecasting demand, managing lead times, and minimizing stock-outs or excess inventory.</p> </li> <li> <p>Distributing products: Supply chain management can help organizations to effectively distribute their products to customers, whether through direct-to-consumer channels or through intermediaries such as wholesalers or retailers. This can involve managing transportation logistics, warehousing and storage, and customer service.</p> </li> <li> <p>Improving efficiency: By optimizing the various activities involved in the supply chain, organizations can improve efficiency and reduce costs. This can involve streamlining processes, automating tasks, and using data analytics to identify inefficiencies and opportunities for improvement.</p> </li> <li> <p>Managing risks: Supply chain management can also help organizations to mitigate risks such as disruptions in the supply chain, quality issues, and delays in delivery. This can involve implementing contingency plans, diversifying suppliers, and monitoring the supply chain for potential risks.</p> </li> <li> <p>Managing global supply chains: Many organizations operate in a global context, with suppliers, manufacturers, and customers located around the world. Supply chain management can help organizations to manage the complexities of a global supply chain, including navigating differences in culture, language, and regulations.</p> </li> <li> <p>Collaborating with partners: Supply chain management can involve working closely with a network of partners, including suppliers, manufacturers, logistics providers, and customers. By using tools such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems and supply chain management software, organizations can improve communication and collaboration with their partners.</p> </li> <li> <p>Implementing sustainable practices: Increasingly, organizations are looking to implement sustainable practices in their supply chains to reduce their environmental impact and improve their social and ethical practices. Supply chain management can help organizations to identify and implement sustainable practices throughout the supply chain, such as reducing waste and emissions, using recycled materials, and supporting ethical labor practices.</p> </li> <li> <p>Responding to disruptions: Disruptions in the supply chain can have significant impacts on an organization's operations, such as delays in delivery, quality issues, and increased costs. Supply chain management can help organizations to anticipate and respond to disruptions in the supply chain, such as by implementing contingency plans or diversifying suppliers.</p> </li> <li> <p>Enhancing customer experience: Ultimately, the goal of supply chain management is to deliver high-quality products and services to customers in a timely and cost-effective manner. By optimizing the various activities involved in the supply chain, organizations can enhance the customer experience and build long-term customer relationships.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Overall, supply chain management is a critical function that plays a key role in the success of businesses in many different industries. By optimizing the various activities involved in the supply chain, organizations can improve efficiency, reduce costs, and better meet the needs of their customers.</p> <p>Warn</p> <p>Work in progress, list examples of use cases that contribute to this capability, making the link to use cases in the catalog at https://catalog.ekgf.org/use-case/..</p>"}, {"location": "pillar/business/business-enablers/supply-chain-management/#contribution-to-the-enterprise", "title": "Contribution to the Enterprise", "text": "<p>In the EKG context, the above ASCM definition of Supply Chain Management could be broadened by also including any detailed supply chain within an ecosystem or enterprise where any one given \"operation\" delivers \"value\" to another \"operation\".</p>"}, {"location": "pillar/business/business-model-elaboration/", "title": "Capability Area \u2014 Business Model Elaboration", "text": "<p>Business Model Elaboration is a Capability Area that is part of the Business Pillar.

These capabilities can be increased through mergers, acquisitions, or joint ventures.  Leaders must also assess the external environment, including market trends, competitor activity,  and regulatory changes, to determine how best to position the organization for success.</p> <p>As part of the wider business strategy, the organization should select a number of strategic  purposeful business themes such as  Transparency, Accountability, Digital Assets or Composable Business, that drive all further decision-making for a given period of time.  These themes are high-level concepts that align with the organization's overall mission and provide  a clear direction for its data-centric initiatives.</p> <p>Once the business capabilities are identified, it's important to translate them into use cases that can drive business value.  This is where the Use Case Tree (UCT) format comes in.  The UCT is a tree-like structure that organizes the identified use cases into a hierarchy,  allowing for a clear understanding of how each use case contributes to the overall business objectives.</p> <p>Leaders also need to ensure that the organization has the right mix of talent, technology,  and processes to execute on its EKG-based strategy effectively.  This includes investing in training and development programs to help employees acquire  new data skills and capabilities, as well as adopting agile methodologies and data-driven  decision-making practices to improve the speed and accuracy of data analysis and delivery.</p> <p>Furthermore, it is crucial to translate the organization's EKG-based strategy into policies  that are fully automatable via the EKG.  For each defined use case, it should be clear which policies are applicable and how they will be modeled, automated, and enforced in the context of the EKG.  This helps ensure consistency and compliance across the organization and enables fully automated digital supply chains.</p> <p>Finally, leaders need to cultivate a culture of innovation and continuous improvement,  where employees are encouraged to experiment, take risks, and learn from data-driven insights.  This requires creating an environment that fosters collaboration, openness, and trust,  and providing employees with the resources and support they need to innovate and drive change.</p> <p>Overall, an EKG-based organizational strategy requires a modern data-centric approach that  considers the interdependencies between data, people, and technology.  By leveraging the power of an EKG, the EKGF Method, semantic technologies, purposeful business themes, and the concept of composable business<sup>1</sup>, organizations can  unlock the full potential of their business capabilities and position themselves to  thrive in a rapidly changing business landscape.</p> <p>Warn</p> <p>Work in progress</p> <p>Warn</p> <p>Work in progress.

In a regulated environment, software installations and hardware will be intentionally deployed by other Information Technology, IT, teams and drive their configuration and support.</p> <p>Infrastructure as code, which can be stored in source control, software allow teams to use markup such as YAML to manage configurations and orchestrate installation. A couple examples of open source software in this space include Ansible, Terraform, and Pulumi. EKG teams should try to leverage this to mitigate IT missteps that can and do occur while delegating the administration of the platform to other groups.</p> <p>Regardless of having the ability to treat infrastructure as code. It\u2019s imperative for the team to have access to an environment where they have privileges to run some of the infrastructure configuration manually and explore, as they may need to provide guidance to other IT teams such as a sandbox and/or lab. A sandbox is very useful to test and validate infrastructure in advance.</p> <p>Sandboxes, which could include a group of virtual machine instances in a lab should be as flexible as possible, and interim ideally. That said, because of the flexibility they offer there could be a tendency for them to become more permanent because of less restrictions. IT support groups will need very concise but relevant documentation to perform tasks, a step by step runbook. The sandboxes in the lab are viable way to create runbook documentation.</p> <p>Runbooks typically have specific configuration information, how to start and stopping software services, necessary permissions, troubleshooting tips, and other relevant server host information.</p> <p>Separate environments are typically defined and adhered to such as Development, User Acceptance Testing Production, Disaster Recovery, defined by IT.  If you are doing machine learning, natural language processing, or anything which requires models , it may be imperative to have Production model training/development. This may seem counter intuitive to have a model training/development, but needed but may be challenging to justify as test data may not be representative due to redaction. </p> <p>Backups should be made both by disk image snapshots of the VMs, and serialized data exports from the software platform tools and utilities.</p> <p>Containerization, such as Docker, and container management, such as Kubernetes and Helm roles/playbooks, while pervasive may not be available. </p> <p>When not available numerous tool package managers such as pip, asdf, npm, brew, chocolatey, nixos, yum, apt are responsible for dependencies for underlying software components inevitably can fill the the gap but must be inventoried, understood, and dealt separately rather than just using as an opaque container provided. Package management can be categorized into operating system level, programming library, and application installation dependencies. This package management is often a time consuming, interwoven, tedious process, which should not to be under estimated for. Package managers can also be invoked from containers and infrastructure as code. \u2028    Typically in-house developed applications deployments are a push vs a pull, due to security requirements. Thus a DevOps pipeline incorporate Build from code, Archive artifacts, Scan for security issues, and Deploy to target server steps. A challenge is that custom applications use many libraries and packages, the application may expect to pull dependencies dynamically even at run time, in practice this may not be feasible on an air-gapped platform.  Dependencies may need to be incorporated prior at build time and archived, and not dynamically at run-time depending on IT regulation and governance.</p> <p>When we are discussing operations, while important to the EKG team we typically are not discussing specific EKG roles of the platform with IT such as ontology versions. That said, we can discuss in terms they may understand such as ETL/ELT, data model management, and application performance vendor or developed in-house. It may be good to try to map terms the EKG is familiar with to IT terminology.</p> <p>Not everything can be mapped to IT terminology and but imperative. For example.Ensuring ontology namespace IRIs are allocated by DNS .  An organization may have a preference for .net versus .com for example. That said, an ontologist may have no preference, unless it doesn\u2019t change.</p> <p>Any sort of artifact that expires such as certificates even DNS name allocations, should be managed by IT operations. These sort of infrastructure challenges may not even be visible or be on the agenda of the EKG team, but if not considered could cause outages while trying to rectify and determining responsibility.</p> <p>Folders need to be organized where data is staged and materialized, not in a haphazard manner, if IT has standards - follow them.</p> <p>Credentials should to be encrypted by a separate group and never given to a development team, if only for a temporary basis for troubleshooting and immediately changed after.</p> <p>You must have a dedicated IT support team to the EKG group, with appropriate access to perform administrative tasks, not necessarily root/admin access but with just the right amount of access to perform application management and/or operating system level changes if and only if the platform requires it.</p> <p>Release notes, platform, and other operational guidance should be published for the team to communicate with IT. It may also need to be restricted as some sensitive information could be maliciously used by sharing the configuration in a non-restricted manner. This information should be need to know only.</p> <p>Logging and system monitoring is also very important but will be covered in a subsequent section.</p>"}, {"location": "pillar/technology/technology-execution/data-transformation-execution/", "title": "D.2.9.

Typically, these databases keep the data in what they refer as a database and/or repository.</p> <p>A couple of approaches to logging RDF DataSet / repository changes which can be used for  propagation are RDF Delta and ChangeSets.</p> <p>RDF Delta uses differences and patch logging to propagate changes.  ChangeSets use reification to express actions that need to be performed on RDF.</p> <p>If a difference log isn\u2019t available then, changes may need to be orchestrated by customized  bespoke approaches or complete non-differential fill exports of repositories.</p> <p>Security changes should be logged for auditing significant changes such as repository creation.  Sensitive/personal identifiable data needs to be kept out of logs in most cases.  This also presents a challenge when troubleshooting, but often a must for compliance.</p> <p>To perform troubleshooting it\u2019s critical that members of the knowledge graph team know  how to access and evaluate output from logs and monitoring software,  as the output from these are usually how root cause is determined for issues and solutions arrived upon.</p> <p>Governance usually requires tracking repositories and retention guidelines for types of data,  so the logging may need an expiration system as it is data. Thus, provenance should be stored within the logs to help provide source metadata, when possible.</p> <p>Warn</p> <p>Work in progress</p> <p>Warn</p> <p>Work in progress.
