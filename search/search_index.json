Michael E. Porter defines strategy as:</p>  <p>Strategy is the creation of a unique valuable position; involving a different set of activities</p>  <p>Valuable positions emerge from three different sources. First, positioning can be based on producing a particular set of products or services. Second, positioning can also be achieved by targeting the needs of a particular customer segment. Third, the last basis for positioning is based on the way customers can be reached as the way to reach a particular segment might differ from other ones even though their needs are very similar. For example, customer could be geographically spread or could be served only through specific channels. Building a strategic position also involves trade-offs in terms of (1) image or reputation, (2) activities and resources, and (3) priorities.</p> <p>Even though these trade-offs might seem undesirable at first sight, they are necessary for a sustainable strategic position according to Porter. These trade-offs reduce the risk of imitation and straddling. The former occurs when a competitor repositions itself to obtain the valuable strategic position of another company. The latter is far more common and occurs when a straddler seeks to obtain the advantages of a valuable strategic position while maintaining its existing position. However, an imitator or straddler may encounter many problems when trying to obtain a strategic position different from the one it already has. For example, a premium retailer may encounter many problems while trying to position itself as a low-price retailer as both positions require different priorities, resources and activities. This transition may even jeopardize the retailer's current strategic position and confuse its consumers by showing them two incongruent images. Therefore, Porter also defines strategy as:</p>  <p>Strategy is making trade-offs in competing. The essence of strategy is choosing what not to do.</p>  <p>Positioning determines not only what activities a company will carry out and how it will set up individual activities but also how activities relate to one another. The latter characteristic is called fit and the most valuable fit is strategy-specific because it enhances a position\u2019s uniqueness and amplifies trade-offs. Creating a fit between activities that is difficult to imitate also creates a sustainable strategic position. Finally, Michael E. Porter also defines strategy as:</p>  <p>Strategy is creating fit among a company\u2019s activities.

An operating model describes how a company wants to thrive and grow.  By providing a more stable and actionable view of the company than strategy,  the operating model drives the design of the foundation for execution.</p>  <p>Defining an operating model in an organization is very important because it enables the adoption of different strategic initiatives as a foundation for execution. Such an operating model represents and reinforces the strategy to be supported. Therefore, the operating model\u2014or the lack of it\u2014has a profound impact on how a company implements business processes and IT.</p> <p>An operating model has two dimensions which are (1) business process standardization and (2) integration:</p> <ol> <li>According to Ross, Weil and Robertson (2006), standardization    of business processes can be defined as; \u201cdefining exactly how a process    will be executed regardless of who is performing the process or where it     is completed. Process standardization delivers efficiency and predictability    across the company\u201d    Business process standardization can lead to large increases in throughput    and efficiency.    However, it comes at a price since the more business processes are standardized,    the more difficult it is to tailor services and products for specific    customer needs hampering innovation and business agility in the process.</li> <li>Business process integration coordinates efforts and work     across organizations through data.    Sharing data can occur between processes to enable end-to-end    transaction processing, or across processes to allow the company     to present a single face to customers.    Some benefits of integration are increased efficiency, coordination,    transparency, and agility.     However, integration entails a large amount of effort such as in     end-to-end integration where companies need to develop standard     data definitions and formats that will be shared and used across different    business units and functions.</li> </ol> <p>Companies adopt an operating model at the enterprise level but could also  adopt different operating models at the division, business region, or other level. In order to define an operating model at any of these different levels, companies need to answer the following two questions (Ross, Weil and Robertson (2006)):</p> <ol> <li>To what extent is the successful completion of one business unit\u2019s    transactions dependent on the availability, accuracy, and timeliness    of other business unit\u2019s data?</li> <li>To what extent does the company benefit by having business units    run their operations in the same way?</li> </ol> <p>The first question determines integration requirements while the second one covers the standardization requirements of an organizations.

This also requires management to identify the company\u2019s key business processes that create a sustainable competitive advantage for the company. As a result, an operating model offers a company the possibility to create and possess reusable capabilities for long-term growth. In this context, an operating model could be seen as the main driver of strategy at a corporate or business level. In addition, an operating model plays a major role in defining the required architecture, practices, management thinking, policies, and processes as they may be different for each operating model.

In such a challenging business world, being able to have a clear oversight  of an organization as a whole has become more critical than ever to  assess risk exposure, to find supply chain bottlenecks,  to comply to regulations among other business requirements.  Therefore, connecting the dots spread inside and outside each company  is necessary for all these crucial tasks.  In this context, the word dots refers to data needed to carry out these  different tasks.</p> <p>However, connecting the dots is far easier said than done as these dots  are most often spread across a myriad of business silos that may not even  aware of each other\u2019s existence and in different formats that make the  task of integrating and harmonizing data across the enterprise overly complex.</p> <p>As a solution to this problem, the Semantic Web and its underlying standards were developed as an answer to integrate, identify, catalogue, harmonize  and assign meaning to individual pieces of data from different sources.  Enterprise Knowledge Graphs (EKGs) aim at doing that at an enterprise-wide  level by using Semantic Web standards and technologies.  Additionally, EKGs can boost other technologies such as machine learning  and blockchain by feeding them with high-quality and meaningful data.</p> <p>The purpose of this maturity model is to guide companies and other  organizations throughout the development of Enterprise Knowledge Graphs  as a tool to develop capabilities that they may consider vital for their  own businesses such as risk management or customer 360\u00b0 and for  which connecting the dots is necessary.  Since this journey will certainly require lots of time and effort,  this maturity model aims at providing a step-by-step rationale of  how companies can develop EKGs that serve their own business needs.  The maturity model will guide enterprises throughout its different maturity levels that will mark the progress of the Enterprise in developing EKG(s) for this kind of enterprise-wide use cases. In order to make the utility of Knowledge Graphs for enterprises clearer, this part will provide some examples of how knowledge graphs  could be used to tackle the aforementioned problems and to  connect the dots for some use cases.  However, the decision of which use cases need to be supported and  prioritized is up to each enterprise.  Therefore, the following examples are just mere illustrations of  what companies can do by connecting the dots.</p> <p>People using Amazon\u2019s Alexa, ordering food through Uber Eats or  booking a listing on Airbnb are using a knowledge graph even if  they are totally unaware of that.  Amazon, Alexa, Uber among other cutting-edge companies have been  using knowledge graph technology to disrupt entire sectors and  to create new value propositions to their customers.1 For example, Amazon uses a product graph to categorize products on its retail website and to make better product suggestions to  customers among other things.2 In that context, Knowledge Graphs fulfills the role of  disruption enabler.  In order to illustrate this, it will be discussed how Airbnb uses  a knowledge graph to enhance its customer experience by integrating and conducting computer reasoning on data coming from different data sources.  </p> <p>On the other hand, Enterprise Knowledge Graphs may also provide great value when being used to support the daily operations of  a business and, in that context, the enterprise is their end user.  Although there are fewer examples of knowledge graphs being used  in this context, Deloitte\u2019s white papers discusses how  knowledge graphs could be used in organizations to unravel  the intricacies of their own business processes, relationships, supply chains, etc. by the means provided by Enterprise Knowledge Graphs as a business supporting/enabling technology.</p>", "title": "Value proposition of EKG"}, {"location": "article/value-proposition-of-ekg/#customer-experience-enhancement-at-airbnb", "text": "<p>In order to move towards its vision of becoming an end-to-end  travel platform, Airbnb needs to be able to provide customers  insights that help them decide when to travel, where to travel  and what to do in their trips. For instance, Airbnb needs to  be able to answer queries such as:</p> <ul> <li>What are the most popular landmarks and neighborhoods in London?</li> <li>Which Airbnb listings are best suited for working nomads?</li> <li>What are the most popular Italian restaurants in New York?</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>Answering these queries may help travelers plan their trips much better and, in turn, Airbnb may increase its  customer value proposition. </p> <p>As a means to answer all these customer queries,  Airbnb uses a knowledge graph represented by the figure on the right.</p> <p>As explained by Chang (2018)3, semantic web knowledge graphs  offer the ability of structuring and adding meaning to data  from different sources such as relational databases in a scalable  way to answer these queries.  Additionally, it is far simpler to connect data about a  certain object spread across different data sources with a  knowledge graph than it is with a relational database.  Another advantage of knowledge graphs compared to  relational databases is that new relationships between concepts  or objects can be added to a knowledge graph in a much more  flexible and simpler fashion.   For instance, knowledge graphs can link the concept surfing as  a sport to the concept surfing which Hawaii is known for.  So, if a customer asks Airbnb\u2019s website for surfing destinations,  Hawaii may appear on the query results. This kind of associations might be far more difficult in a  relational environment especially if the data about them  come from different sources with different schemas.</p> <p>By connecting data about places, experiences, homes, restaurants,  etc. as illustrated here, Airbnb is able to answer complicated user queries4 such as What events, restaurants and  homes are located in Mission District in San Francisco? as shown  on the right and below.</p> <p>In this way, Airbnb is moving forward into becoming an end-to-end  travel platform that serves its customers throughout their entire  journeys instead of only renting listings out.</p>   <ol> <li> <p>Food Discovery with Uber Eats: Building a Query Understanding Engine \u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>All You Need to Know to Build a Product Knowledge Graph \u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>Spencer Chang: Scaling Knowledge Access and Retrieval at Airbnb \u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>Xiaoya Wei: Contextualizing Airbnb by Building Knowledge Graph \u21a9</p> </li> </ol>", "title": "Customer experience enhancement at Airbnb"}, {"location": "intro/", "text": "<p>The EKG/MM is the industry-standard definition of the capabilities required for an EKG and of the generic capabilities in any given organization that are affected by EKG.</p> <p>It establishes standard criteria for measuring progress and sets out the practical questions that all involved stakeholders ask to ensure trust, confidence and usage flexibility of data.

It\u2019s up to the \"fixer\" (usually called \"developer\" in most git documentation on the Internet) to decide which tooling they use. One way to do this is to just use the Github website itself but you could also create a so-called \"clone\" of the git repository on your  local machine and use the standard git utility to create a commit or  use an advanced editor like Visual Studio Code that has built-in git and Markdown support. It goes too far to document all the various different ways to do this  in the context of this document. What\u2019s important to know is that, as a fixer, you should always include the issue number in the title of the commit.  For example, if you edit a content page and then commit that change,  you have to make sure that these two things are done before clicking  the \"Propose Changes\" button as shown in the figure above.</p> <p>Use a title for your commit that includes the issue number,  prefixed by <code>#</code>, for example, <code>#123</code> for issue 123. Use a branch name that includes the issue number (no hash as a prefix).</p> <p>The <code>#123</code> in the title will trigger GitHub to move the corresponding issue from the \"To Do\" column to the \"In Progress\" column. Do not use <code>Fixed #123</code> or <code>Close #123</code> because that  will actually close the issue.</p> <p>Once you have done your first commit to a given branch, you\u2019re ready to create a PR.  Many people wait with creating a PR until their last commit is pushed (one issue can involve many commits involving many files, but they all  go to the same branch) but we recommend creating your PR as soon as possible,  after the first commit, because that gives everyone an easier insight  in the progress. Not everyone is up for that, \u201cexposing\u201d their  first draft changes to others, but it\u2019s generally seen as  good practice doing so.  You can mark your PR as \u201cDraft\u201d via the GitHub user interface so that  everyone knows that it is \u201cwork in progress\u201d.</p>", "title": "How to commit a change?"}, {"location": "other/process/#how-to-create-a-pull-request", "text": "<p>Assuming that you added some changes to a branch, in GitHub parlance:  \"pushed some commits to a branch\", you can also create a PR.

GitHub automatically calculates the difference between those two branches and shows those differences on the PR-form.</p> <p>There are several places in the GitHub user interface where you  can start creating a PR but the most basic one shows up at the branches page which shows all branches of the repository:</p> <ul> <li>https://github.com/ekgf/ekg-mm/branches</li> </ul> <p>On the right side of the table showing all the branches you either see an  existing PR for the given branch or a button:</p> <p></p> <p>It\u2019s easy from there.

The artifacts take a variety of forms ranging from free-form documentation of manuals, data and process models along different methodologies to  data records and programming repositories. Business Capability Models,  Business Canvas,  Business Reference Architectures etc  have been some of the outputs used to serve as organization-wide  references of activities.</p> <p>The objectives guiding such management are mostly around efficiency of  categorizing, storing and retrieval, focused around \u201cwhat is done\u201d and \u201cwho does it\u201d. The key challenge in efficiency oriented approaches is that the perception can be quite subjective based on the needs of the  departments or teams \u2014 which leads to a variety of approaches across the length and breadth of any enterprise. There are several implications of using such a variety of approaches \u2014 chief amongst which is the reconciliation effect expended every time a  deviation has to be managed, exceptions have to be handled or a change  introduced in any activity. Targeting efficiency of reconciliations through techniques such as  focus-groups, standardization of documentation etc. is a typical response of most organizations.</p> <p>Taking the intuitive notion of a Business Identity (as a conceptual  anchor for an organization\u2019s engagement with its stakeholders)  forward, enterprises can benefit from using a simple, organization-wide  concept anchor focused around \u201cwhy is it done\u201d for its activities. This anchor need not be prescriptive to change the way an organization manages its activities but descriptive to enhance the ability to more effectively leverage information within the artifacts.</p> <p>One candidate for such an intuitive anchor is the contract. In fact, a contract may initially take the form of a memorandum of  understanding (MOU), an agreement outlined in a formal document that may later become a legal contract. If we take the Business Identity as a basis for viewing an  organization\u2019s product and services, a contract can be seen as a  specific engagement around which the activities of various  departments and teams are organized. More specifically, a contract can be seen as a collection of  related commitments, potentially spread over time, which provide the necessary context for any activity in an organization. Interestingly, while it's well-understood that a contract is a  definitive source of specifics around any agreement with  stakeholders, it's currently referred to only in the extreme case  of legal recourse in handling disagreements.

The artifacts take a variety of forms ranging from free-form documentation of manuals, data and process models along different methodologies to  data records and programming repositories. Business Capability Models,  Business Canvas,  Business Reference Architectures etc  have been some of the outputs used to serve as organization-wide  references of activities.</p> <p>The objectives guiding such management are mostly around efficiency of  categorizing, storing and retrieval, focused around \u201cwhat is done\u201d and \u201cwho does it\u201d. The key challenge in efficiency oriented approaches is that the perception can be quite subjective based on the needs of the  departments or teams \u2014 which leads to a variety of approaches across the length and breadth of any enterprise. There are several implications of using such a variety of approaches \u2014 chief amongst which is the reconciliation effect expended every time a  deviation has to be managed, exceptions have to be handled or a change  introduced in any activity. Targeting efficiency of reconciliations through techniques such as  focus-groups, standardization of documentation etc. is a typical response of most organizations.</p> <p>Taking the intuitive notion of a Business Identity (as a conceptual  anchor for an organization\u2019s engagement with its stakeholders)  forward, enterprises can benefit from using a simple, organization-wide  concept anchor focused around \u201cwhy is it done\u201d for its activities. This anchor need not be prescriptive to change the way an organization manages its activities but descriptive to enhance the ability to more effectively leverage information within the artifacts.</p> <p>One candidate for such an intuitive anchor is the contract. In fact, a contract may initially take the form of a memorandum of  understanding (MOU), an agreement outlined in a formal document that may later become a legal contract. If we take the Business Identity as a basis for viewing an  organization\u2019s product and services, a contract can be seen as a  specific engagement around which the activities of various  departments and teams are organized. More specifically, a contract can be seen as a collection of  related commitments, potentially spread over time, which provide the necessary context for any activity in an organization. Interestingly, while it's well-understood that a contract is a  definitive source of specifics around any agreement with  stakeholders, it's currently referred to only in the extreme case  of legal recourse in handling disagreements. Another perception of contracts is that they do not cover all  collaboration contexts which guide activities in an organization.</p> <p>Contracts have several features which help align the  Business Identity with the activities within an enterprise \u2014 and the wider ecosystem, for that matter.</p> <ul> <li>Together with the legal system and societal norms,    contracts provide a contextual basis for belief/trust    between an enterprise and its stakeholders in the ecosystem</li> <li>Contracts are specific to the parties involved and provide    an ideal contextual basis for (hyper)personalisation of    products and services \u2014 through bounded simulation of    contract performance</li> <li>Measures of performance in organizational activities,    such as cost, operational efficiencies and innovation    effectiveness can be aligned to contractual performance contexts</li> </ul> <p>We now look at two key elements of organizational activity (enabled by EKG) aimed at orienting and realizing  business strategy, through the lens of Business Identity and Contracts:</p> <ul> <li>Business Strategy Actuation   is a business identity oriented process that senses,    understands and communicates business outcome-based    assessment data to focus energy and resources on   strategic objectives.

To make the distinction between a capability and a process, capabilities should be named with nouns such as    customer management instead of a verb managing customers.</li> <li>Capabilities should be defined in business term and not in technical terms.    Executives and other business professionals should be able to clearly understand what a capability means    \u2014and take ownership of it\u2014without being bothered with the technical details of the systems    that implement it.</li> <li>Capabilities should be stable (i.e. least volatile) as possible.    There is a fundamental set of high-level capabilities that are necessary to run a business regardless    of the sector of industry it is located in. Additionally, high-level capabilities may rarely change    within an organization unless there are significant changes to its business strategy or organization.</li> <li>Capabilities are not redundant.
