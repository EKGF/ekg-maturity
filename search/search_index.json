Michael E. Porter defines strategy as:</p>  <p>Strategy is the creation of a unique valuable position; involving a different set of activities</p>  <p>Valuable positions emerge from three different sources. First, positioning can be based on producing a particular set of products or services. Second, positioning can also be achieved by targeting the needs of a particular customer segment. Third, the last basis for positioning is based on the way customers can be reached as the way to reach a particular segment might differ from other ones even though their needs are very similar. For example, customer could be geographically spread or could be served only through specific channels. Building a strategic position also involves trade-offs in terms of (1) image or reputation, (2) activities and resources, and (3) priorities.</p> <p>Even though these trade-offs might seem undesirable at first sight, they are necessary for a sustainable strategic position according to Porter. These trade-offs reduce the risk of imitation and straddling. The former occurs when a competitor repositions itself to obtain the valuable strategic position of another company. The latter is far more common and occurs when a straddler seeks to obtain the advantages of a valuable strategic position while maintaining its existing position. However, an imitator or straddler may encounter many problems when trying to obtain a strategic position different from the one it already has. For example, a premium retailer may encounter many problems while trying to position itself as a low-price retailer as both positions require different priorities, resources and activities. This transition may even jeopardize the retailer's current strategic position and confuse its consumers by showing them two incongruent images. Therefore, Porter also defines strategy as:</p>  <p>Strategy is making trade-offs in competing. The essence of strategy is choosing what not to do.</p>  <p>Positioning determines not only what activities a company will carry out and how it will set up individual activities but also how activities relate to one another. The latter characteristic is called fit and the most valuable fit is strategy-specific because it enhances a position\u2019s uniqueness and amplifies trade-offs. Creating a fit between activities that is difficult to imitate also creates a sustainable strategic position. Finally, Michael E. Porter also defines strategy as:</p>  <p>Strategy is creating fit among a company\u2019s activities. The success of a strategy depends on doing many things well\u2014not just a few\u2014and  integrating among them.</p>","title":"What is Business Strategy?"},{"location":"appendix/enterprise-architecture/","text":"<p>Antwerp, 2021, Carlos Tubbax.</p> <p>Once a company has defined one or several operating models depending on its business process integration and standardization requirements, it can then draw its enterprise architecture that reflects the company\u2019s key processes, systems, and data embedded at the company's core.

An operating model describes how a company wants to thrive and grow.  By providing a more stable and actionable view of the company than strategy,  the operating model drives the design of the foundation for execution.</p>  <p>Defining an operating model in an organization is very important because it enables the adoption of different strategic initiatives as a foundation for execution. Such an operating model represents and reinforces the strategy to be supported. Therefore, the operating model\u2014or the lack of it\u2014has a profound impact on how a company implements business processes and IT.</p> <p>An operating model has two dimensions which are (1) business process standardization and (2) integration:</p> <ol> <li>According to Ross, Weil and Robertson (2006), standardization    of business processes can be defined as; \u201cdefining exactly how a process    will be executed regardless of who is performing the process or where it     is completed. Process standardization delivers efficiency and predictability    across the company\u201d    Business process standardization can lead to large increases in throughput    and efficiency.    However, it comes at a price since the more business processes are standardized,    the more difficult it is to tailor services and products for specific    customer needs hampering innovation and business agility in the process.</li> <li>Business process integration coordinates efforts and work     across organizations through data.    Sharing data can occur between processes to enable end-to-end    transaction processing, or across processes to allow the company     to present a single face to customers.    Some benefits of integration are increased efficiency, coordination,    transparency, and agility.

In order to define an operating model at any of these different levels, companies need to answer the following two questions (Ross, Weil and Robertson (2006)):</p> <ol> <li>To what extent is the successful completion of one business unit\u2019s    transactions dependent on the availability, accuracy, and timeliness    of other business unit\u2019s data?</li> <li>To what extent does the company benefit by having business units    run their operations in the same way?</li> </ol> <p>The first question determines integration requirements while the second one covers the standardization requirements of an organizations.

In such a challenging business world, being able to have a clear oversight  of an organization as a whole has become more critical than ever to  assess risk exposure, to find supply chain bottlenecks,  to comply to regulations among other business requirements.  Therefore, connecting the dots spread inside and outside each company  is necessary for all these crucial tasks.  In this context, the word dots refers to data needed to carry out these  different tasks.</p> <p>However, connecting the dots is far easier said than done as these dots  are most often spread across a myriad of business silos that may not even  aware of each other\u2019s existence and in different formats that make the  task of integrating and harmonizing data across the enterprise overly complex.</p> <p>As a solution to this problem, the Semantic Web and its underlying standards were developed as an answer to integrate, identify, catalogue, harmonize  and assign meaning to individual pieces of data from different sources.  Enterprise Knowledge Graphs (EKGs) aim at doing that at an enterprise-wide  level by using Semantic Web standards and technologies.  Additionally, EKGs can boost other technologies such as machine learning  and blockchain by feeding them with high-quality and meaningful data.</p> <p>The purpose of this maturity model is to guide companies and other  organizations throughout the development of Enterprise Knowledge Graphs  as a tool to develop capabilities that they may consider vital for their  own businesses such as risk management or customer 360\u00b0 and for  which connecting the dots is necessary.  Since this journey will certainly require lots of time and effort,  this maturity model aims at providing a step-by-step rationale of  how companies can develop EKGs that serve their own business needs.  The maturity model will guide enterprises throughout its different maturity levels that will mark the progress of the Enterprise in developing EKG(s) for this kind of enterprise-wide use cases. In order to make the utility of Knowledge Graphs for enterprises clearer, this part will provide some examples of how knowledge graphs  could be used to tackle the aforementioned problems and to  connect the dots for some use cases.  However, the decision of which use cases need to be supported and  prioritized is up to each enterprise.  Therefore, the following examples are just mere illustrations of  what companies can do by connecting the dots.</p> <p>People using Amazon\u2019s Alexa, ordering food through Uber Eats or  booking a listing on Airbnb are using a knowledge graph even if  they are totally unaware of that.  Amazon, Alexa, Uber among other cutting-edge companies have been  using knowledge graph technology to disrupt entire sectors and  to create new value propositions to their customers.1 For example, Amazon uses a product graph to categorize products on its retail website and to make better product suggestions to  customers among other things.2 In that context, Knowledge Graphs fulfills the role of  disruption enabler.  In order to illustrate this, it will be discussed how Airbnb uses  a knowledge graph to enhance its customer experience by integrating and conducting computer reasoning on data coming from different data sources.  </p> <p>On the other hand, Enterprise Knowledge Graphs may also provide great value when being used to support the daily operations of  a business and, in that context, the enterprise is their end user.  Although there are fewer examples of knowledge graphs being used  in this context, Deloitte\u2019s white papers discusses how  knowledge graphs could be used in organizations to unravel  the intricacies of their own business processes, relationships, supply chains, etc. by the means provided by Enterprise Knowledge Graphs as a business supporting/enabling technology.</p>","title":"Value proposition of EKG"},{"location":"article/value-proposition-of-ekg/#customer-experience-enhancement-at-airbnb","text":"<p>In order to move towards its vision of becoming an end-to-end  travel platform, Airbnb needs to be able to provide customers  insights that help them decide when to travel, where to travel  and what to do in their trips.

Another advantage of knowledge graphs compared to  relational databases is that new relationships between concepts  or objects can be added to a knowledge graph in a much more  flexible and simpler fashion.   For instance, knowledge graphs can link the concept surfing as  a sport to the concept surfing which Hawaii is known for.

They are often quite vocal in their points of view\u2014always striving to make their work better and better and better. However, an Enterprise Knowledge Graph must, by definition, represent the views of the collective, not the views of individuals. Therefore, collectively, we present Maturity Model Release Version 1.0. Some may call it a draft version. Readers may find portions unfinished, and some sections say, \u201cWe welcome your input here.\u201d This input will go into the EKGF Continuous Improvement Process.</p> <p>This is where you come in. Join our workgroups and participate in working towards Release Version 2.0.</p> <p>The Enterprise Knowledge Graph Foundation team

In recent years, the word capability has steadily been drawing attention in the business world as a way to narrow the gap between business and IT. A capability is described by Ulrich and Rosen, (p.1, 2011) as:</p>  <p>A business capability, or simply a \u201ccapability,\u201d defines what a business does. It does not communicate or expose where, why, or how something is done\u2014only what is done. Specifically, the business capability is \u201ca particular ability or capacity that a business may possess or exchange to achieve a specific purpose or outcome.</p>  <p>Understanding what a business does is at least as important as understanding how it does it. Focusing on the what rather than on the how often provides the right level of abstraction of complex ecosystems in a way that can be easily digested by business executives and planning teams. Dissecting a business as a set of basic capabilities allows one to view complex organizations and business environments in a wide range of different ways. Additionally, one could zoom in on lower levels of abstraction to reach higher levels of detail depending on the needs of the target audience.</p> <p>Consider the example of the high-level capability called customer 360\u00b0. This capability refers to having a complete picture of the customer and this is a capability many organizations may benefit from. A customer may be called a taxpayer in the context of a government institution, a patient in the context of a hospital and a student in the context of a university. Being able to manage different aspects of a customer might be imperative for many businesses depending on their business strategy. For instance, customer 360\u00b0 as a high-level capability could entail the customer trend analysis and customer management information capabilities as lower-level capabilities.</p> <p>In other words, this means that capabilities are concerns that could be refined into lower-level capabilities that in turn could be further refined. The advantage of functional decomposition in this hierarchical and modular way is that it increases the reusability of capabilities across business lines, enterprises or even industries. Additionally, decomposing capabilities in different levels of abstraction offers a better sense of how capabilities fit in on the overall view of the enterprise.</p> <p>Capabilities should follow certain principles as follows:</p> <ol> <li>Capabilities define what a business does and not how a business does it.     This implies that a capability does not refer to a process or value stream.</li> <li>Capabilities are nouns, not verbs.     To make the distinction between a capability and a process, capabilities should be named with nouns such as     customer management instead of a verb managing customers.</li> <li>Capabilities should be defined in business term and not in technical terms.     Executives and other business professionals should be able to clearly understand what a capability means     \u2014and take ownership of it\u2014without being bothered with the technical details of the systems     that implement it.</li> <li>Capabilities should be stable (i.e. least volatile) as possible.     There is a fundamental set of high-level capabilities that are necessary to run a business regardless     of the sector of industry it is located in. Additionally, high-level capabilities may rarely change     within an organization unless there are significant changes to its business strategy or organization.</li> <li>Capabilities are not redundant.     Capabilities appear once and only once on a capability maps even though they are shared by more than division,     business line or business unit of an enterprise.</li> <li>There should only be one business capability map per business.     In order to bring transparency across the organization, there should be a single unified and harmonized     business capability map per business.     Therefore, business capabilities spread throughout different business units, divisions, department,     lines of business, etc should be only appear once in the business capability map.</li> <li>Capabilities map to\u2014but are not the same as\u2014business processes, business units,     Lines of Business (LOBs) and value streams.     There is rarely a one-to-one mapping between a business process, a business unit, an LOB or     a value stream, and a capability.     Therefore, mistaking a capability with one these other concepts may result in an overly complex overview of     things that are constantly repeated across the enterprise.     Additionally, we\u2019re trying to understand the what rather than the how and this would not be possible if capabilities are mistaken with  process-related concepts.</li> <li>Automated capabilities are still business capabilities and not IT capabilities.     Capabilities are owned by the business as they are made by and for the business.     Therefore, a capability that has been automated with an IT system is not an IT capability.     Instead, it is nothing else than an automated business capability.</li> <li>Capabilities are the most valuable when incorporated in the overall pictures of a business\u2019 ecosystem.     While being useful in a stand-alone basis for discussion and planning, capabilities fulfil their biggest     potential by being combined into a larger business capability map that represents the business ecosystem     of an enterprise.</li> </ol>","title":"Summary"},{"location":"pillar/business/capability-area/business-enablers/capability/operating-model/","text":"","title":"Operating Model"},{"location":"pillar/business/capability-area/business-enablers/capability/operating-model/#summary","text":"<p>The capability Operating Model is part of the capability area Business Enablers in the Business  Pillar.
