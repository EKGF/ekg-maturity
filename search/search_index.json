Michael E. Porter defines strategy as:</p>  <p>Strategy is the creation of a unique valuable position; involving a different set of activities</p>  <p>Valuable positions emerge from three different sources. First, positioning can be based on producing a particular set of products or services. Second, positioning can also be achieved by targeting the needs of a particular customer segment. Third, the last basis for positioning is based on the way customers can be reached as the way to reach a particular segment might differ from other ones even though their needs are very similar. For example, customer could be geographically spread or could be served only through specific channels. Building a strategic position also involves trade-offs in terms of (1) image or reputation, (2) activities and resources, and (3) priorities.</p> <p>Even though these trade-offs might seem undesirable at first sight, they are necessary for a sustainable strategic position according to Porter. These trade-offs reduce the risk of imitation and straddling. The former occurs when a competitor repositions itself to obtain the valuable strategic position of another company. The latter is far more common and occurs when a straddler seeks to obtain the advantages of a valuable strategic position while maintaining its existing position. However, an imitator or straddler may encounter many problems when trying to obtain a strategic position different from the one it already has. For example, a premium retailer may encounter many problems while trying to position itself as a low-price retailer as both positions require different priorities, resources and activities. This transition may even jeopardize the retailer's current strategic position and confuse its consumers by showing them two incongruent images. Therefore, Porter also defines strategy as:</p>  <p>Strategy is making trade-offs in competing. The essence of strategy is choosing what not to do.</p>  <p>Positioning determines not only what activities a company will carry out and how it will set up individual activities but also how activities relate to one another. The latter characteristic is called fit and the most valuable fit is strategy-specific because it enhances a position\u2019s uniqueness and amplifies trade-offs. Creating a fit between activities that is difficult to imitate also creates a sustainable strategic position. Finally, Michael E. Porter also defines strategy as:</p>  <p>Strategy is creating fit among a company\u2019s activities.

An operating model describes how a company wants to thrive and grow.  By providing a more stable and actionable view of the company than strategy,  the operating model drives the design of the foundation for execution.</p>  <p>Defining an operating model in an organization is very important because it enables the adoption of different strategic initiatives as a foundation for execution. Such an operating model represents and reinforces the strategy to be supported. Therefore, the operating model\u2014or the lack of it\u2014has a profound impact on how a company implements business processes and IT.</p> <p>An operating model has two dimensions which are (1) business process standardization and (2) integration:</p> <ol> <li>According to Ross, Weil and Robertson (2006), standardization    of business processes can be defined as; \u201cdefining exactly how a process    will be executed regardless of who is performing the process or where it     is completed. Process standardization delivers efficiency and predictability    across the company\u201d    Business process standardization can lead to large increases in throughput    and efficiency.    However, it comes at a price since the more business processes are standardized,    the more difficult it is to tailor services and products for specific    customer needs hampering innovation and business agility in the process.</li> <li>Business process integration coordinates efforts and work     across organizations through data.    Sharing data can occur between processes to enable end-to-end    transaction processing, or across processes to allow the company     to present a single face to customers.    Some benefits of integration are increased efficiency, coordination,    transparency, and agility.     However, integration entails a large amount of effort such as in     end-to-end integration where companies need to develop standard     data definitions and formats that will be shared and used across different    business units and functions.</li> </ol> <p>Companies adopt an operating model at the enterprise level but could also  adopt different operating models at the division, business region, or other level. In order to define an operating model at any of these different levels, companies need to answer the following two questions (Ross, Weil and Robertson (2006)):</p> <ol> <li>To what extent is the successful completion of one business unit\u2019s    transactions dependent on the availability, accuracy, and timeliness    of other business unit\u2019s data?</li> <li>To what extent does the company benefit by having business units    run their operations in the same way?</li> </ol> <p>The first question determines integration requirements while the second one covers the standardization requirements of an organizations.

For instance, Airbnb needs to  be able to answer queries such as:</p> <ul> <li>What are the most popular landmarks and neighborhoods in London?</li> <li>Which Airbnb listings are best suited for working nomads?</li> <li>What are the most popular Italian restaurants in New York?</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>Answering these queries may help travelers plan their trips much better and, in turn, Airbnb may increase its  customer value proposition. </p> <p>As a means to answer all these customer queries,  Airbnb uses a knowledge graph represented by the figure on the right.</p> <p>As explained by Chang (2018)3, semantic web knowledge graphs  offer the ability of structuring and adding meaning to data  from different sources such as relational databases in a scalable  way to answer these queries.  Additionally, it is far simpler to connect data about a  certain object spread across different data sources with a  knowledge graph than it is with a relational database.  Another advantage of knowledge graphs compared to  relational databases is that new relationships between concepts  or objects can be added to a knowledge graph in a much more  flexible and simpler fashion.   For instance, knowledge graphs can link the concept surfing as  a sport to the concept surfing which Hawaii is known for.  So, if a customer asks Airbnb\u2019s website for surfing destinations,  Hawaii may appear on the query results. This kind of associations might be far more difficult in a  relational environment especially if the data about them  come from different sources with different schemas.</p> <p>By connecting data about places, experiences, homes, restaurants,  etc. as illustrated here, Airbnb is able to answer complicated user queries4 such as What events, restaurants and  homes are located in Mission District in San Francisco? as shown  on the right and below.</p> <p>In this way, Airbnb is moving forward into becoming an end-to-end  travel platform that serves its customers throughout their entire  journeys instead of only renting listings out.</p>   <ol> <li> <p>Food Discovery with Uber Eats: Building a Query Understanding Engine \u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>All You Need to Know to Build a Product Knowledge Graph \u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>Spencer Chang: Scaling Knowledge Access and Retrieval at Airbnb \u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>Xiaoya Wei: Contextualizing Airbnb by Building Knowledge Graph \u21a9</p> </li> </ol>", "title": "Customer experience enhancement at Airbnb"}, {"location": "intro/", "text": "<p>The EKG/MM is the industry-standard definition of the capabilities required for an EKG and of the generic capabilities in any given organization that are affected by EKG.</p> <p>It establishes standard criteria for measuring progress and sets out the practical questions that all involved stakeholders ask to ensure trust, confidence and usage flexibility of data.

In some cases that would be all there is to it but in most cases you  have multiple edits in multiple files for one given issue.  So in those cases you would have to make sure to always refer to  the right branch name where the branch name must include the  issue number itself.

It\u2019s up to the \"fixer\" (usually called \"developer\" in most git documentation on the Internet) to decide which tooling they use. One way to do this is to just use the Github website itself but you could also create a so-called \"clone\" of the git repository on your  local machine and use the standard git utility to create a commit or  use an advanced editor like Visual Studio Code that has built-in git and Markdown support. It goes too far to document all the various different ways to do this  in the context of this document. What\u2019s important to know is that, as a fixer, you should always include the issue number in the title of the commit.  For example, if you edit a content page and then commit that change,  you have to make sure that these two things are done before clicking  the \"Propose Changes\" button as shown in the figure above.</p> <p>Use a title for your commit that includes the issue number,  prefixed by <code>#</code>, for example, <code>#123</code> for issue 123. Use a branch name that includes the issue number (no hash as a prefix).</p> <p>The <code>#123</code> in the title will trigger GitHub to move the corresponding issue from the \"To Do\" column to the \"In Progress\" column. Do not use <code>Fixed #123</code> or <code>Close #123</code> because that  will actually close the issue.</p> <p>Once you have done your first commit to a given branch, you\u2019re ready to create a PR.  Many people wait with creating a PR until their last commit is pushed (one issue can involve many commits involving many files, but they all  go to the same branch) but we recommend creating your PR as soon as possible,  after the first commit, because that gives everyone an easier insight  in the progress. Not everyone is up for that, \u201cexposing\u201d their  first draft changes to others, but it\u2019s generally seen as  good practice doing so.  You can mark your PR as \u201cDraft\u201d via the GitHub user interface so that  everyone knows that it is \u201cwork in progress\u201d.</p>", "title": "How to commit a change?"}, {"location": "other/process/#how-to-create-a-pull-request", "text": "<p>Assuming that you added some changes to a branch, in GitHub parlance:  \"pushed some commits to a branch\", you can also create a PR.  A PR can be seen as a \"request approval to change\"-form.  It needs two branches: the branch that you want to change (that would  usually be the main branch) and the branch that contains the new version  with the proposed changes.  GitHub automatically calculates the difference between those two branches and shows those differences on the PR-form.</p> <p>There are several places in the GitHub user interface where you  can start creating a PR but the most basic one shows up at the branches page which shows all branches of the repository:</p> <ul> <li>https://github.com/ekgf/ekg-mm/branches</li> </ul> <p>On the right side of the table showing all the branches you either see an  existing PR for the given branch or a button:</p> <p></p> <p>It\u2019s easy from there.
