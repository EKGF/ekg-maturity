\section{Meaning}\label{sec:ekg-principle-meaning}

The meaning of every \gls{data-point} must be directly resolvable 
to a machine-readable mathematical definition.

A \gls{data-point} combines an object with the value of a \textit{property} in some context. 
Hence data is expressed at its most granular level for both data at rest and data in motion.

A \gls{property} itself is an object, with its own identity, which is defined through further properties 
based on logic that allow information to be rigorously combined, queried and inferred. 
These properties that define properties are standardized by the W3C and are grouped 
into \textit{ontologies} for management purposes.
However the machine-readable logic does not replace natural language definitions that 
link the properties and statements to the real world.

\paragraph{Rationale} Expressing data at a granular level allows ultimate flexibility 
for it to be sliced, diced, combined and aggregated. This capability to combine and 
infer information is further enhanced by the use of \gls{property} definitions built on logic.
Having the properties themselves be objects that can be looked up means that all data 
is self-defining and carries its meaning with it.
Since the information is self-defining there is no fixed schema for the \gls{ekgf} 
as a whole and it can non-disruptively incorpate additional knowledge.

\paragraph{Implications} Some further discovery, with subject matter experts and 
creators of source systems, is often needed to truly understand what a given 
set of data really means and what can be inferred from it. 
In other words you cannot rely on the name of a column in a spreadsheet. 
A deceptively simple column name such as "number of European customers" leaves 
open the meaning of "European" and "customer" and timing (when does one start 
and stop being a customer?). And different sources could have different 
interpretations of that same name.
The benefit is consistency, accuracy and the ability to make sound business decisions.
