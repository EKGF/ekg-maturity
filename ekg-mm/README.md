# ekg-mm

This is the old content directory where we used to work with LaTeX generating a PDF.
We've moved on to using Markdown instead and no longer generate that PDF but a website: https://maturity.ekgf.org.

However, some of the content has not been ported yet to the new structure.

Also, we use this directory to store the RDF Turtle files that define the structure of the Maturity Model.

This starts with the top-level file [model.ttl](./model.ttl).
