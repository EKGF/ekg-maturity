\section{Performance Management}\label{sec:ekgmm-a-3-1}

Measure a process to manage performance.

\somequote{\glsfirst{epm}\,---\,
The process of monitoring performance across the enterprise with the goal of improving business performance.
An \gls{epm} system integrates and analyzes data from many sources, including e-commerce systems, front- and back-office
applications, data warehouses, and external data sources.
Advanced \gls{epm} systems can support many performance methodologies, such as the balanced scorecard.

In the \gls{ekg} context, \gls{epm} would be one of the use cases that the \gls{ekg} can run where it would potentially
not run in isolation as a siloed system dependent on attestations or poor system integration but tap in to detailed
real data from all relevant data sources, potentially enabling "real-time performance management".
