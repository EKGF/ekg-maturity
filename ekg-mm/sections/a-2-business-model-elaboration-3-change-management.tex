\paragraph*{More background}

Change is happening everywhere in organizations.
The \iindex{digitalization} of everything (\gls{iot}?, \iindex{edge computing}, \iindex{digital transformation})
has created a fluid context for change, and the need to decentralize decision-making to keep pace with
exponential change and complexity requires \iindex{non-linear thinking}, planning, and execution.

The current approaches for change management are usually built on linear models which do not scale nor can they collate
the facets of data\,---\,let alone semantic perspectives\,---\,that are overwhelming decision makers.

\Glspl{ekg} are the only way to build a scalable framework of understanding about change and capture relevant patterns
to guide option analysis and impact analysis.
The days of getting in a room and relying on meetings is quickly coming to an end.
\Gls{ai}, Bayesian Analysis\index{bayesian analysis}, Game Theory\index{game theory}, \gls{mcda},
and Heuristics can help, but \myuline{only} if we can guide them properly using \glspl{ekg}.
