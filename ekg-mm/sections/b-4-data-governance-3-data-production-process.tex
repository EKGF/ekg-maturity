\ekgmmContextSection

Management of the production/consumption process is one of the essential components of data management.
It is based on an understanding of what data is being exchanged and the ability to map dependencies and
transformations (\iindex{lineage}).
The knowledge graph is the logical distribution point for data manufacturing\,---\,leveraging the ontology to ensure
consistency of meaning across systems, people and processes.
The \glsxtrshort{ekg} can trace data flow and validate that defined use cases are aligned with agreed usage and
obtained from authoritative sources.
Entitlements and redistribution rights are automatically tracked and fully auditable.
Data quality rules\index{data!quality!rules} rules are linked to business vocabulary and structurally enforced
across systems and processes to ensure consistency.

\begin{core-questions}

  \item [\thesection.1] Is the data production/consumption process documented and verified from authoritative sources
                        to consuming applications
  \item [\thesection.2] Are the requirements for data quality (and criticality) defined, verified and expressed as SLAs
                        or other forms of data sharing agreement
  \item [\thesection.3] Is there an inventory of SLAs and is data production monitored against these agreements
  \item [\thesection.4] Is the data production/consumption process connected to ontologies and
                        official business glossaries
  \item [\thesection.5] Are entitlements, permissions and authorizations tracked as data flows across systems
  \item [\thesection.6] Can data quality errors and deficiencies be traced back to where the data originated
  \item [\thesection.7] Are the data production/consumption governance processes in place and operational
                        (\iindex{ownership} and \iindex{accountability})
