  Example objectives: [^1]

  - Stay Competitive.
    - Comprehensive, client-focused services.
    - Outstanding expertise and service quality.
  - Increase agility reacting to or delivering on Risk & Regulatory requirements.
    - Comply with ethical, data privacy and security guidelines.
  - Drastically decrease "time to market" of the implementation and realization of new business ideas from
    inception to production.
    - Offer more tailor-made services to each client.
  - Silos are holding us back: lack of "360 degree views" and not having the full picture is a
    drag on competitiveness, no more (new) silos.

  _Business Tactics_ are the actions performed that ensure business change capabilities are focused on 
  business value realization.
  To determine that added value is created by a particular business change, 
  the key factors used for metric generation can be made explicit in the EKG.
  
  Business Tactics, which specify the actions to focus and align business activities and pursuits
  to the realization of the Business Goals practices around agility in business change, 
  as well as real-time focus on monitoring of key internal and external BAU-metrics have enabled
  enterprises to make frequent tactical corrections in their activities.
  A significant component of such corrections is a judgment that relies on human intuition, bias
  and expertise, guided by associated business metrics.
