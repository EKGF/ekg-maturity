\ekgmmCapability{c-2-1}{ontologies}{Ontologies}

An ontology is about:

\begin{itemize}
    \item explicit meanings and relationships; the terms used are less important
    \item a combination of definitions in both text and logic
\end{itemize}

An ontology can be the basis of, but is broader than:
\begin{itemize}
    \item a taxonomy\index{taxonomy}
    \item a vocabulary\index{vocabulary}
    \item a data or object model\index{data!model}\index{object model}
    \item a conceptual model\index{conceptual model}
    \item a specific serialization format\index{serialization format}
\end{itemize}

Ontologies can be expressed at different levels of sophistication, with different scopes,
and in a combination of languages.
The basic structures include:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=.8in,font=\itshape]
    \item [individual] a representation of a business object or item which is the subject of information to be managed.
                       An individual\index{individual} usually has a unique identity.\index{identity}
                       For example \lstinline|Person X| or \lstinline|Shipment Y|.
                       Many such individuals might represent the same real world object.
    \item [data value] strings, numbers, dates which represent the data.
    \item [property]   a type of data point that may be associated with individuals.
                       An individual, a property\index{property} and a value\,---\,which may be a data value or another
                       individual\,---\, form a triple.\newline
                       For example person \lstinline|X hasBirthDate D| or person \lstinline|X hasMother Y|.
                       Triples whose value is another individual form relationships.
                       Properties may have generalizations, for example \lstinline|hasMother| is a
                       \lstinline|subProperty| of \lstinline|hasParent|.
    \item [class]      a category applied to individuals, that determines what you can do with them,
                       the properties you can expect to see, and the rules that might apply;
                       an individual may be a member of many classes associated;
                       classes may have generalizations.
                       Note that, unlike more traditional approaches, properties are independent of
                       classes\index{class} though they may be used to infer\index{inference} class membership.
                       For example, given the triple \lstinline|X hasMother Y| you may be able to infer that both
                       \lstinline|X| and \lstinline|Y| are members of the class \lstinline|Person|,
                       or at least \lstinline|Animal|.
    \item [ontology]   grouping of the above for management and identification purposes.
\end{itemize}
