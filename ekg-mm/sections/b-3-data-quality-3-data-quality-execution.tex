Data in the knowledge graph is aligned to precise meaning so that errors and definitional conflicts are
verified at source before they are introduced into operational systems.
In the knowledge graph data, rules and metadata are co-resident and reusable without impedance mismatch.
Quality execution is rules-based and unhooked from both schemas and data models that are tailored to
specific applications.
Metadata is embedded into the content so that users always understand what the data represents as it moves across
organizational boundaries.
