\section{Critical Data Elements}\label{sec:ekgmm-b-4-5} % B.4.5 Classification Management

Critical data elements (CDEs) are designated as having a material impact on a business process, regulatory report, financial calculation or risk measure.
The designation of a data element as critical means it is important enough to be governed by organizational policy.
CDE management is implemented as a negotiation process between producers and consumers that requires precision of meaning,
understanding of data flow, capture of business rules and the management of quality based on how the data will be used.
Many firms use the term CDE to describe various things such as data attributes, business concepts, derived processes and physical expressions.
This confusion over nomenclature about concepts makes it difficult to distinguish granular data from how it is assembled into business measures and how it is expressed in physical data repositories.

In the \glsxtrshort{ekg}, critical data are defined by data quality business rules and expressed as machine-executable models
These rules are automatically executed across systems, processes and applications to ensure consistency.
Data is linked to the ontology and resolved to a single identifier to mitigate confusion about meaning when the data is onboarded or transformed.
The \glsxtrshort{ekg} is able to trace data flow and verify that criticality is aligned with \glsxtrfullpl{sor} and agreed usage.
