\section{Data Management Policy}\label{sec:ekgmm-b-4-2} % B.4.2 Data Management Policy

Data management policies are the mandated requirements to ensure effective management of an organizationâ€™s information assets.
Policies are implemented via operating models, standards and documented procedures.
Data management policies define requirements related to data access (e.g. authorized sources, entitlements, usage and redistribution),
data quality (e.g. metadata, definitions, modeling and business rules), organizational governance (e.g. accountabilities and alignment with business processes) and control functions (e.g. retention, security, privacy and change management).
