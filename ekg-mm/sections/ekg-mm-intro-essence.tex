\section{Maturity Model in Essence}

\centerimg[width=\dimexpr\textwidth+3pt\relax,height=300pt]{KGMM-Levels-Essence.png}

This diagram is a view of \glsfmtshort{ekgmm} expressed in Essence.
The shaded background shows the four Areas of Concern, identified by colours:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Business (green)
    \item Data (blue)
    \item Technology (yellow)
    \item Organisation (grey)
\end{enumerate}

Across the top, separated into the appropriate Area of Concern, are the Alphas.
These are the intangible concepts that we need to progress through maturity.
The states of the Alphas are progressed by performing Activities (not shown in this diagram).
The levels of maturity are shown as the horizontal bands across the Areas of Concern and Alphas.
The red triangles indicate checkpoints that need to be achieved to reach each level.
The checkpoints are specified as required states for each Alpha.
These required states are shown on the lifelines for Alpha.
