\ekgmmContextSection

In the \gls{ekg} context, \gls{epm} would be one of the use cases that the \gls{ekg} can run where it would potentially
not run in isolation as a siloed system dependent on attestations or poor system integration but tap in to detailed
real data from all relevant data sources, potentially enabling "real-time performance management".


We welcome your input here.
