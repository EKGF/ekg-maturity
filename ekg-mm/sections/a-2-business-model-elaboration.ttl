        and applications operated by the business, as well as to its internal equipment, resources, operating systems,
        and procedures.

  mitigate risk, obtain a good result for divesting and/or acquiring new areas of business, product changes for
  shifts in customer needs, improve processes for efficiency and cost savings, stay ahead of competitors,
  take advantage of new technologies, etc.

  product development, business organization and staffing, new sales channels, process improvement, technology change,
  compliance to changes in regulations, and more.
