\ekgmmHowEKGRequiresThisCapability

Having the Value Chain(s) of an organization defined can help with the selection, definition and prioritization of
the right use cases for the \gls{ekg}.

\ekgmmHowEKGAffectsThisCapability

In the \gls{ekg} context, a "digital twin" of a company's value chain can be modelled where all the various components
of the value chain are represented e.q. all details around logistics, supply chains, operations, services, marketing,
sales and all support activities.
At higher levels of maturity, all real-world details of these components are available as well and represent
the reality accurately and in "real time".

We welcome your input here.
