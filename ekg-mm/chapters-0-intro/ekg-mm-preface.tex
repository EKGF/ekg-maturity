\chapter{Preface}\label{ch:ekg-mm-preface}

The \gls{ekgf} was chartered in early 2020.
Of the many ideas discussed for initial projects, the founders agreed that writing and publishing a Maturity Model
for the \gls{ekg} should be the first effort of the membership.

The idea of representing the \gls{ekgmm} as four pillars titled Business, Organization, Data, and Technology,
was presented in a June 2020 kickoff webinar.

This concept was accepted.
Weekly pillar Zoom working sessions began shortly thereafter.
These ongoing workgroups debate the contents toward the achievement of consensus in each pillar.
Once a week the team leaders meet to synchronize content.

Our workgroups are lively and conversational.
They are filled with people who are knowledge experts in their fields.
They are often quite vocal in their points of view\,---\,always striving to make their work better and better and better.
However, an Enterprise Knowledge Graph must, by definition, represent the views of the collective,
not the views of individuals.
Therefore, collectively, we present Maturity Model Release Version 1.0.
Some may call it a draft version.
Readers may find portions unfinished, and some sections say, “We welcome your input here.”
This input will go into the EKGF Continuous Improvement Process.

This is where you come in.
Join our workgroups and participate in working towards Release Version 2.0.
