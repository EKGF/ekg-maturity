The \gls{ekgmm} is the industry-standard definition of the capabilities required for an \gls{ekg} and
of the generic capabilities in any given organization that are affected by \gls{ekg}.

It establishes standard criteria for measuring progress and sets out the practical questions that all involved
stakeholders ask to ensure trust, confidence and usage flexibility of data.
Each capability area provides a business summary denoting its importance, a definition of the added value from
semantic standards and scoring criteria based on five levels of defined maturity.

The \gls{ekgmm} is a capability model designed to promulgate best practices across the knowledge graph community.
It covers essential capabilities as well as standard evaluation criteria required for the design, implementation,
