In the \glsxtrshort{ekg}, \glspl{cde} are defined by data quality business rules\index{data!quality!rules}
and expressed as machine-executable models\index{executable models}.\improve{i.e. ontologies}

    JAG>We should be more explicit about this by saying that \glspl{cde}
    basically do not exist as such anymore, a data element is deemed critical from the point of view of the
    enterprise perhaps but that's just one viewpoint, one context.
    In the \gls{ekg} we have to serve any viewpoint.
    For every use case there are data elements (concepts) that are critical which may be a whole
    different set of data elements than what enterprise level deems to be critical.
    All data elements are critical somewhere in some context.
    This has to do with the "\glsfirst{svot} delusion".
    It's of course fine to label certain data elements as "critical" but it should be tied to the use case.
    Data element X is critical for use case Y.},
These rules are automatically executed across systems, processes and applications to ensure consistency.
Data is linked to the ontology and resolved to a single identifier to mitigate confusion about meaning when the
data is onboarded or transformed.
The \glsxtrshort{ekg} is able to trace data flow and verify that criticality is aligned with \glspl{sor}
and agreed usage.
