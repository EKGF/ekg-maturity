% B.4.4 Risk and Control Environment -- Contribution to the Enterprise
%
Control processes in the \glsxtrshort{ekg} environment are managed as a structured set of executable business rules
or models\,---\,in the \gls{ekg}, and automatically enforced across all use cases.
The meaning of the data is structurally validated at the point of data capture to prevent bad data from
entering the system\improve{avoid "the system", use "\gls{ekg}"} at ingestion.
In the knowledge graph, data and metadata are fully integrated to ensure reusability across systems
and operational processes.
The \glsxtrshort{ekg} is able to map data flow including all dependencies and transformations to verify that
data is obtained from authorized \glspl{sor}, identified according to access rights and
aligned with intended usage.
