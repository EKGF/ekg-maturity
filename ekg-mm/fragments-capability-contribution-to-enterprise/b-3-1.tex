% B.3.1 Business Rules -- Contribution to the Enterprise
%
Data quality is an integrated feature of the \gls{ekg}.
Data quality rules are linked to structured business vocabularies\todo{or better: ontologies} to ensure that meaning
is shared and not obscured by vague terms or cryptic codes.
The logic of business rules and policies are\change{is} captured and expressed as executable models and consistently
enforced across all systems and processes.
These quality constraints (models) allow firms to measure the quality of the data and perform verification across
disparate systems.
In the mature \gls{ekg}, violations of logic or integrity are identified and prevented before data
enters the system.
