\index{capability domain}
All capabilities that we measure \& assess in the \gls{ekgmm}\footnote{See \cite{ekgmm}} are categorized
in four major categories\,---\,also called "pillars"\,---\,that match the four primary audiences that are involved:

The Business (Strategy) is leading.
In a "Data-centric"\index{data!centric} organization, Data Strategy\index{data!strategy} comes second and
fully supports the Business Strategy\index{business!strategy}.
Then derived from that we have a supporting and facilitating Technology and Organizational Strategy.
\index{strategy!business strategy}
\index{strategy!data strategy}
\index{strategy!technology strategy}
\index{strategy!organization strategy}

The four capability domains roughly correspond with the four primary audiences that we are addressing:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The audience of people on the business-side
    \item The audience of people in the data-management and data-governance departments
    \item The audience of technologists
    \item The audience of people that are neither business, data nor tech.
\end{enumerate}
