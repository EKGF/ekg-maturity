\index{capability domain}
All capabilities that we measure and assess in the \gls{ekgmm}\footnote{See \autocite{ekgmm}} are categorized
in four major categories\,---\,also called "pillars"\,---\,that match the four primary audiences that are involved:
\index{audience}

The Business (Strategy)\index{strategy!business strategy} is leading.
In a "Data-centric"\index{data!centric} organization,~\nameref{ch:ekg-mm-data-strategy}\index{data!strategy} comes
second and fully supports the Business Strategy\index{business!strategy}.
Then derived from that we have a supporting and facilitating Technology and Organizational Strategy.
\index{strategy!business strategy}
\index{strategy!data strategy}
\index{strategy!technology strategy}
\index{strategy!organization strategy}

These four pillars roughly correspond with the four primary audiences that we are addressing:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The audience of people on the business-side
    \item The audience of people that are project managers, trainers or HR, legal, compliance and finance departments
    \item The audience of people in the data-management and data-governance departments
    \item The audience of technologists
\end{enumerate}
