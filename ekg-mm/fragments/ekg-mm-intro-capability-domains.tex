All capabilities that we measure in the \gls{ekgmm}\footnote{See \cite{ekgmm}} are categorized
in four major categories -- also called "pillars" -- that match the four primary audiences that are involved:

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=1in,font=\bfseries]
    \item [Business]     \myuline{Business Strategy}\index{business!strategy},
                         Business Architecture\index{business!architecture}, Alignment,
                         \Gls{operating-model}, does not include the actual Business Capabilities
                         \index{business!capabilities} themselves
    \item [Data]         All Data (Management) capabilities including \myuline{Data Strategy}
    \item [Technology]   All Technology Capabilities including \myuline{Technology Strategy}
    \item [Organization] All relevant Organizational Capabilities including \myuline{Organizational Strategy}
\end{enumerate}

Business (Strategy) is leading.
In a "\iindex{Data-centric}" organization, \iindex{Data Strategy} comes second and fully supports the
Business Strategy\index{business!strategy}.
Then derived from that we have a supporting and facilitating Technology and Organizational Strategy.
\index{strategy!business strategy}
\index{strategy!data strategy}
\index{strategy!technology strategy}
\index{strategy!organization strategy}
