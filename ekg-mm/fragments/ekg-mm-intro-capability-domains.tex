All capabilities that we measure in the \gls{ekgmm}\footnote{See \cite{ekgmm}} are categorized
in four major categories -- also called "pillars" -- that match the four primary audiences that are involved:

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=1in,font=\bfseries]
    \item [Business]     \ul{Business Strategy}, Business Architecture, Alignment, Operating Model,
                         does not include the actual Business Capabilities themselves
    \item [Data]         All Data (Management) capabilities including \ul{Data Strategy}
    \item [Technology]   All Technology Capabilities including \ul{Technology Strategy}
    \item [Organization] All relevant Organizational Capabilities including \ul{Organizational Strategy}
\end{enumerate}

Business (Strategy) is leading.
In a "Data-centric" organization\index{Data-centric}, Data Strategy comes second and fully supports the Business Strategy.
Then derived from that we have a supporting and facilitating Technology and Organizational Strategy.
