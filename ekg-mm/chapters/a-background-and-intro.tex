\chapterNoNumber{Introduction \& Background}

The modern economy is often characterized as an Information Economy\index{information economy} or more specifically,
Knowledge Economy\index{knowledge economy},
emphasizing the importance of knowledge as the key productivity lever and \iindex{intellectual capital} as the
key differentiator of enterprises.
Widespread \iindex{digitalization} over the last two decades has accelerated the scale, reach and impact of
businesses in today’s knowledge economy.
Seven of the top ten firms globally by market capitalization at the time of this writing (
Apple\index{company!Apple},
Amazon\index{company!Amazon},
Microsoft\index{company!Microsoft},
Alphabet\index{company!Alphabet}\index{company!Google},
Facebook\index{company!Facebook},
Tencent\index{company!Tencent},
Alibaba\index{company!Alibaba}),
are representative of this characterization.
This underscores the broad expectation that future competitiveness is increasingly focused on embedding and
capitalizing knowledge in the design, delivery and eventual effectiveness of products, services and activities
in business models of Enterprises.

What does a knowledge-based differentiated focus in products and services mean for enterprises?
Prevalent characterization of some business models offers some clue:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]

    \item Embedded Finance\,---\,the emphasis that convenience of financial products is increasingly determined by
          integrating them seamlessly into non-financial applications and processes.
          Embedded Finance offers a new, very large addressable market opportunity worth over \$7 trillion in
          ten years' time, twice the combined value of the world’s top 30 banks today.\autocite{embeddedfinance}

    \item Subscription Services\,---\,the emphasis that experience of products and services is increasingly determined
          not from broad contours of use over time but by specific contexts of use at any given time.
          78\% of international adults in 2021 have subscription services (71\% in 2018).
          And 75\% believe that in the future, people will subscribe to more services and own less physical "stuff".
          \autocite{subscriptioneconomy}

    \item Platform Services\,---\,the emphasis that utility of services is increasingly determined not from clarity of
          individual service but through convenience of search and similarity of use
          across a range of related products and services.
          More than 30\% of global economic activity\,---\,some \$60 trillion\,---\,could be mediated by
          digital platforms\index{digital platform}\index{digital!platform} by 2025.\autocite{ifyourenotbuilding}

\end{enumerate}

            being created at the pace only possible with one billion workers.

            products and services mean for enterprises?

In the following sections, we explore a few illustrative capabilities that enable enterprises to leverage and embed
knowledge in their propositions, products and services, planning and activities.

\sectionNoNumber{The Business Case for Explorative Execution}

Business performance\index{business!performance} is traditionally measured with \iindex{metrics} emphasising
\iindex{financial performance}\,---\,typically, aspects of
revenue\index{business!revenue},
profit\index{business!profit},
growth\index{business!growth} and
risk\index{business!risk}.
Mechanisms such as Balanced Scorecards\index{balanced scorecard} help enterprises align \iindex{strategy execution}
to their business performance, emphasising the causal chains coursing through organizational capability, operations and
customer propositions, eventually landing into financial performance as an outcome.
More recently, there has been an emphasis on key stakeholder metrics such as \glsxtrshort{esg} adding further
dimensions to responsible business performance.

The paradigm of business performance has largely hinged on organizations directly influencing their customer
engagements with their products and services.
Indeed, the prevalent use of the term "customer"\index{customer} is ingrained as a counterpart to the organizations’
products\index{business!products} and services\index{business!services}.
Dramatic advances in the digital economy, especially in the area of mobile and sensor technology over the last 15 years,
have highlighted the perception of value through insights into consumption/use.
In other words, the presumed value in organizations’ products and services is increasingly validated through
actual insights into consumption/use by consumers.

This shift in perspective of an organizations’ products and services as patterns (based on insights) of consumer use
is where movements such as \iindex{design thinking}, \iindex{customer journey maps} etc are increasingly considered
as important tools for developing and validating propositions.
The "aha" and "viola" moments from such exercises require further translation into realizing the propositions,
which is where practices around agility, DevOps\index{DevOps} etc are increasingly mainstream.

All these themes and mechanisms of strategy execution through communication, product/service propositions,
development/deployment and its performance management\index{business!performance}\index{performance management}
largely depend on a human capital\index{human capital} based on participation, expertise and intuition.
Organizations wishing to amplify their human capital face a few key dichotomies to be addressed:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Customer vs Consumer}: Mindset and capability shift from ``Customer market share'' to
          ``share of (end) consumer value''
    \item \textbf{Enterprise vs Ecosystem}: Mindset and capability shift from
          “Proprietary control of customer experiences” to “open collaboration on consumer experiences”
    \item \textbf{Human Machine Continuum}: Mindset shift from human-scaled to machine-scaled
          (intelligent and autonomous) business capability
\end{itemize}
Each of the above dichotomies highlights the limitations enterprises face today in extending business capability
beyond their organizational boundaries, be it in sourcing information beyond their own channels or collaborating
on shared experiences.

Addressing these challenges requires enterprises to adopt an exploratory style in executing their
strategy\footnote{See \Nameref{ch:ekg-mm-what-is-strategy}},
which specifically focuses on sensing and understanding the consumer ecosystem better before taking decisions
and acting (to be aligned to hyper-personalization, both in retail and business consumer scenarios)

To put this “Explorative Execution” into perspective, a useful mental model is \gls{suda}
(a slight variant of John Boyd’s OODA loop),
specifically focused on responding/acting in a dynamic evolving environment.
The choice of the mental model is to bring out its contrast with the imperative style mental model of \gls{pdca},
usually used for acting in an environment of more certainty and predictability.

\begin{description}[font=\bfseries,nosep,leftmargin=!,labelwidth=\widthof{\bfseries UNDERSTAND}]
    \item[SENSE] Accessing actual contents of need and use by consumers easily overwhelms most organizations
    for a variety of reasons, chief amongst which is the sheer volume of context-unique interactions which
    must be checked for links to an organization’s business interests and intents.
    Most of this is practiced subjectively and accorded to human expertise and intuition.
    \item[UNDERSTAND] Unlike the carefully curated lens of its products and services,
    inputs of interest for an organization are generally ambiguous requiring significant efforts to
    disambiguate and synthesize.
    (John Boyd’s Orientation isn’t just a state you’re in; it’s a process. You’re always orienting.)
    \item[DECIDE] Disambiguated information still isn’t directly actionable as there is a significant element of
    hypothesis embedded within.
    This is especially challenging with high prevalence of conflicting hypotheses in many cases.
    \item[ACT] Filtered sensing, hypothesis-based understanding and scenario-driven decision-making finally
    create an actionable context, which the organizational operations can execute.
\end{description}

A deeper analysis of the \gls{suda} loop of “Explorative Execution” brings into focus the following requirements
of capability:

\begin{description}[font=\bfseries,nosep,leftmargin=!,labelwidth=\widthof{\bfseries Open world ambiguity}]
    \item[Identity] how can sensing be practiced in a subject domain of multiple identities?
    How can a shift from form-based to a function-based identity be enabled?
    \item[Self-describing] how can understanding be practiced in a subject domain with multiple descriptions?
    How can a shift from structure-based description to a behavior-based description be enabled?
    \item[Open world ambiguity] how can decision-making be practiced in scenarios which require constant
    revalidation and conflict resolution, as new facts become known?
\end{description}

\myuline{\textit{An \gls{ekg} is a key organizational capability to enable Explorative Execution using a \gls{suda} mental model}},\\
through the following core features:

\begin{description}[font=\bfseries,nosep,leftmargin=!,labelwidth=\widthof{\bfseries UNDERSTAND}]
    \item[SENSE]
        \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1em]
            \item Co-existence of multiple identifications based on context and interpretation instead of
                  the prevalent content based identification
            \item How do retail consumers and business consumers use products and services?
        \end{itemize}
    \item[UNDERSTAND]
        \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1em]
            \item Emphasis on meaning through association rather than static descriptions
            \item Enhanced collaboration with ecosystem partners through standards on context sharing
                  rather than lengthy negotiations on content specifics
            \item How do the products and services address needs of consumers?
        \end{itemize}
    \item[DECIDE]
        \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1em]
            \item Significant scale in knowledge driven operations through autonomous reasoning
            \item Leverage of existing (diverse and federated) content sources instead of
                  separate curated content repositories
            \item How can products and services add more value through effective use?
            \item What changes can be made to make products and services more relevant
                  for (retail and business) consumers?
        \end{itemize}
\end{description}

\sectionNoNumber{Business Identity}\label{sec:ekg-mm-business-identity}

\nameref{sec:ekg-mm-business-identity} is a statement of a company's unique innovation, service, and/or product based
value proposition.\index{value proposition}
A \nameref{sec:ekg-mm-business-identity}, published to the world via business identifier unique \glsxtrlongpl{ekg},
may transparently use a data infrastructure that can support many distinct business activities.

An enterprise could have multiple Business Identities based on the value propositions underlying its
products and services\,---\,it is imperative that each must be perceived (as having differentiators) and
consumed (as unique offerings) by its customers and stakeholders.

\begin{itemize}
    \item The \textbf{Sense} imperative is addressed by using the Business Identity\index{business!identity}
          as an “attractor” amidst the voluminous stream of interactions.
          This is especially important in a privacy conscious environment where interest in and intent of using
          information is clearly understood and agreed upon upfront.
    \item The \textbf{Understand} imperative is addressed by using the Business Identity as a common link between the
          complementary mechanisms of (a) fulfilment within an enterprise and (b) the collaboration contexts with
          the partners.
    \item The \textbf{Decide} imperative is addressed by using the Business Identity as an enterprise persona for scenario
          planning and evaluation - rather than viewing an enterprise as a structural entity.
\end{itemize}

Business Identity\index{business!identity} enables an (\gls{ekg} powered) enterprise to constantly
assess and align its value propositions to
\begin{enumerate*}[(a)]
    \item the needs and use contexts of consumers and
    \item the collaboration mechanisms with business partners for effective fulfilment.
\end{enumerate*}

Examples of prominent \textit{brand statements}:

\begin{description}[font=\bfseries,nosep,leftmargin=!,labelwidth=\widthof{\bfseries Apple Watch}]
    \item[Apple Watch] \index{company!Apple}
                       \textit{It’s the ultimate device for a healthy life.
                       Apple Watch can do what your other devices can't because it's on your wrist.
                       When you wear it, you get a fitness partner that measures all the ways you move,
                       meaningful health insights, and a connection to the people and things you care about most.
                       And it's always just a glance away.}
    \item[Netflix]     \index{company!Netflix}
                       \textit{Unlimited films, TV programmes and more. Watch anywhere. Cancel at any time.
                       Netflix is a subscription-based streaming service that allows our members to watch TV shows
                       and movies without commercials on an internet-connected device.}
\end{description}

A Business Identity can link brand statements such as the above with the wider contexts of an
Enterprise’s corporate values, vision etc and the specifics of the product/service features and
integration with other products/services of the enterprise/wider ecosystem.

\paragraph*{Aligning Business Identity with Activities in an Enterprise}\index{business!identity}

Enterprises use a variety of mechanisms today to organize “inventories” of their activities.
The artifacts take a variety of forms ranging from free-form documentation of manuals,
data and process models along different methodologies to data records and programming repositories.
Business Capability Models, Business Canvas, Business Reference Architectures etc have been some of the
outputs used to serve as organization-wide references of activities.

The objectives guiding such management are mostly around efficiency of categorizing, storing and retrieval,
focused around “what is done” and “who does it”.
The key challenge in efficiency oriented approaches is that the perception can be quite subjective based
on the needs of the departments or teams - which leads to a variety of approaches across the length and
breadth of any enterprise.
There are several implications of using such a variety of approaches\,---\,chief amongst which is the
reconciliation effect expended every time a deviation has to be managed,
exceptions have to be handled or a change introduced in any activity.
Targeting efficiency of reconciliations through techniques such as focus-groups, standardization of documentation etc.
is a typical response of most organizations.

Taking the intuitive notion of a Business Identity (as a conceptual anchor for an organization’s engagement with
its stakeholders) forward, enterprises can benefit from using a simple, organization-wide concept anchor
focused around “why is it done” for its activities.
This anchor need not be prescriptive to change the way an organization manages its activities but descriptive to
enhance the ability to more effectively leverage information within the artifacts.

One candidate for such an intuitive anchor is the contract.
In fact, a contract may initially take the form of a memorandum of understanding (MOU), an agreement outlined in a
formal document that may later become a legal contract.
If we take the Business Identity\index{business!identity} as a basis for viewing an organization’s product and services,
a contract can be seen as a specific engagement around which the activities of various departments and teams are
organized.
More specifically, a contract can be seen as a collection of related commitments, potentially spread over time,
which provide the necessary context for any activity in an organization.
Interestingly, while it's well-understood that a contract is a definitive source of specifics around any
agreement with stakeholders, it's currently referred to only in the extreme case of legal recourse in
handling disagreements.
Another perception of contracts is that they do not cover all collaboration contexts which guide activities
in an organization.

Contracts have several features which help align the Business Identity\index{business!identity} with the activities
within an enterprise\,---\,and the wider ecosystem, for that matter.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*]
    \item Together with the legal system and societal norms, contracts provide a contextual basis for
          belief/trust between an enterprise and its stakeholders in the ecosystem
    \item Contracts are specific to the parties involved and provide an ideal contextual basis for
          (hyper)personalisation of products and services\,---\,through bounded simulation of contract performance
    \item Measures of performance in organizational activities, such as cost, operational efficiencies and
          innovation effectiveness can be aligned to contractual performance contexts
\end{enumerate}

We now look at two key elements of organizational activity (enabled by \gls{ekg}) aimed at orienting and
realizing business strategy, through the lens of \nameref{sec:ekg-mm-business-identity}\index{business!identity}
and Contracts:
