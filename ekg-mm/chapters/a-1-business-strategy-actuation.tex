\TODO[inline]{JAG>Carlos \& Avinash to decide which summary of Appendix \nameref{ch:ekg-mm-what-is-strategy} to put here}

As a refinement of the above definition, \textbf{\nameref{ch:ekg-mm-business-strategy-actuation}} is the process of
identifying measurement values\,---\,e.g. speed, time\,---\,for planned object change activities\,---\,e.g.
add, remove, move\,---\,that will provide an accurate way of assessing whether strategic objectives and
associated business goals\index{business!goals} have been fulfilled.

\textit{Actuation}\index{actuation} is an inspired term\,---\,in common use, it denotes the action of causing a
machine or device to start.
In the business world, \textit{Business Strategy} is about intent, and \textit{Strategy Actuation}
can be seen as activating that intent.
The broad business imperatives of \glsfirst{suda} for a modern, forward-looking Enterprise,
based on the "siren call" of its \textit{Business Identity}\index{business!identity},
have been established in the introductory section on page~\pageref{sec:ekg-mm-business-identity}.

This section suggests mechanisms wherein \gls{ekg} can help Businesses in aligning their Strategy Actuation to
the \gls{suda} imperatives.
While practices around Business Strategy vary across Enterprises\,---\,for historical reasons and
management preferences\,---\,they broadly cover the following key elements of Business Intent\index{business!intent}
and its cascade within the Enterprise:

To summarize, \textbf{\nameref{ch:ekg-mm-business-strategy-actuation}} is a business identity oriented process
that senses, understands and communicates \iindex{business outcome}-based assessment data to focus energy and
resources on strategic objectives.
Actuation measurement values are used to assess whether strategic objectives and associated business goals are
being fulfilled, such as:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Speed of change\,---\,%
    which propositions, and their contractual commitments, will benefit from an enhanced speed of change?

    \item Speed of awareness\,---\,%
    which contractual commitments will benefit from an enhanced ability to assess and respond?

    \item Speed of understanding impacts\,---\,%
    which commitments require a focus on demonstrating suitability through impact analysis?

    \item Speed of adapting to one or more changes\,---\,%
    which commitments are most at risk on the speed of adapting to changes?

    \item Ability to identify errors and understand their impacts\,---\,%
          how do exceptions relate to commitments and how does exception management affect commitments?
    \item Ability to measure error propagation and assess scale
    \item Ability to manifest change to respond to errors
\end{itemize}
