% B.4.3 Data Production \& Consumption -- Summary
%
Data originates from a wide variety of business processes and flows through multiple systems before it is
ingested into applications and analytical functions.
As data flows across this “chain of supply”\index{supply chain}\index{data!supply chain}\,---\,it can be renamed,
enriched, transformed and updated (many times).
Data producers\index{data!producer}\index{data!publisher} and consumers\index{data!consumer} must work collaboratively
to ensure that the data is fit for its intended purposes.\index{fit for purpose}
This necessitates communications about the requirements for quality as well as an understanding of
how the data is being used, where it originates, how it has been transformed and its consistency with original intent.
