% B.2.2 Ontologies -- Summary
%
Within an \gls{ekg}, ontologies are the models that provide the structure and meaning of the information.
An ontology is a set of formal definitions for the key concepts that organize and structure an
organizationâ€™s information.
Having ontologies provides a common denominator level of unification that allows information to be shared and
communicated between different use cases and shareholders, regardless of the different sources,
structures and vocabulary they might use.
