Data modeling\improve{JAG>Why is this about (old school) data modeling and not about "meaning resolution" as in principle 2?}
is a formal process designed to describe the data needed to support the business functions within an organization.
Effective data modeling is a communications mechanism to ensure a shared understanding of requirements between
business stakeholders and use case developers.
Data modeling\,---\,via either ontology design or more traditional techniques\,---\,results in agreed terminology,
precise definitions, and alignment of the models to business thinking, rules constraints.
