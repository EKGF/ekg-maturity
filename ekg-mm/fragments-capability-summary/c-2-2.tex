    JAG>We may want to call this "EKG Operate" or "Operate EKG", unless we want to make this about more than just
    the operations around the EKG itself. It could be that all operations in the technology landscape could be
    covered by this capability, at "level 5" I'd say that should be the case anyway. At level 1 this capability is
    however "just" about "operating your own EKG".%
