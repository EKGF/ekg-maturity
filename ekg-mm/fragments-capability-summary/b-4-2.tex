% B.4.2 Data-management Policy -- Summary
%
Data management policies are the mandated requirements to ensure effective management of an organizationâ€™s
information assets.\index{data management}\index{data management!policy}
Policies are implemented via \glspl{operating-model}\index{data management!operating model},
standards\index{data management!standards} and documented procedures.
Data management policies define requirements related to data access (e.g. authorized sources, entitlements,
usage and redistribution), data quality (e.g. metadata, definitions, modeling and business rules),
organizational governance (e.g. accountabilities and alignment with business processes) and
control functions (e.g. retention, security, privacy and change management).
\TODO[inline]{%
    JAG>data access requirements, in so far they're use case related, should be tied to use cases. We should make
    a distinction between dataset-specific access requirements and use case specific access requirements.%

\TODO[inline]{%
    JAG>At the higher maturity levels, all dataset related policies (all the above)
    should be captured as RDF data, OWL ontologies and/or SHACL shapes and be made part
    of any self-describing dataset (SDD).%
