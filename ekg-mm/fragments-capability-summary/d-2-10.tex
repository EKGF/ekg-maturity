% D.2.10 Identity Resolution -- Summary
%
Identity resolution is a process of combining multiple identifiers across devices, spreadsheets, repositories, and
platforms into a cohesive profile.
The process includes searching across disparate datasets and analyzing content to find (and resolve) matches based
on available data records and attributes.
Identity resolution is complicated by distinctions in both structure and meaning because various information systems
can vary in quality, completeness, format, and nomenclature.
