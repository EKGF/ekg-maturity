    JAG>A better term for the "Search \& Query" capability may be "Discover" (or "Sense" as in \gls{suda}).
    This capability is basically one to one what a good "EKG/UX" should provide, providing an integrated user
    experience where searching, querying, asking questions, discovering is all one user interface basically.
    Even reporting comes into that, any user should be able to create a report for themselves or for others, slicing
    and dicing data until it becomes understandable for a given purpose, much like Excel is used today.
    In other words, that's much more than just "Search \& Query".
