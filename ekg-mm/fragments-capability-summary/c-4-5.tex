% C.4.5 Classification Management -- Summary
%
\glsreset{cde}\Glspl{cde} are designated as having a material impact on a business process, regulatory report,
financial calculation or risk measure.
The designation of a data element as critical means it is important enough to be governed by organizational policy.
\Gls{cde} management is implemented as a negotiation process between producers and consumers that require
precision of meaning, understanding of data flow, capture of business rules and the management of quality based on
how the data will be used.
Many firms use the term \gls{cde} to describe various things such as data attributes, business concepts,
derived processes and physical expressions.
This confusion over nomenclature about concepts makes it difficult to distinguish granular data from how it is
assembled into business measures and how it is expressed in physical data repositories.

    throughout this document?
