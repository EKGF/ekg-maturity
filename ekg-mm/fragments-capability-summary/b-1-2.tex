\TODO[inline]{%
    Should we move "B.1.2 Business Case" to the business pillar? Pro: sounds like it.%
    Con: This is about the business case for the EKG itself.%
    Which is not completely a data-pillar-only concern but something that should be the result of the set business%
    strategy. But it may be the most logical place to have this business case (for the EKG) done here.%
