\chapter{\glsfmtshort{ekgf} Documents}\label{ch:ekgf-documents}

Work in progress, create an overview of all major documents/deliverables that the EKGF is working on or going to work on.

    \item[\gls{ekgmanifesto}]
        The \gls{ekgmanifesto} is a combination of long term vision statements\,---\,the
        "Why"\,---\, combined with the underlying \iindex{principles}
        for \gls{ekg}\,---\,the "How".

    \item[\gls{ekgmethod}]
        The assumption is that each organization in a data-intensive industry will end up
        owning their own \gls{ekg}\,---\,possibly shared across organizations\,---\,and therefore
        requires oversight by a group of people\,---\,however organized\,---\,that we call
        the \gls{ekg:coe}.
        \gls{ekgmethod} describes all the practices of the \gls{ekg:coe}, from inception to production.

    \item[EKG/Catalog]
        The EKG/Catalog describes all the common use cases (and some of their "sub-use cases")
        for \gls{ekg}.
        The goal is to also publish these use cases on the ekgf.org website under the so-called
        "use case portal" and make them available for download as modules, basically the same
        kind of ecosystem of reusable components as any other successful technology-stack has.
        This is comparable to what \href{https://central.sonatype.org/}{"Maven Central"} is for
        the Java world or what \href{https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm}{"npmjs.com"} is for the
        JavaScript world.
