        this concept is defined in many different ways.
        One way is to say that "critical data elements are those data elements that are critical to success in a
        specific business area".
        This could be a regulatory area such as BCBS 239 or the enterprise as a whole or any other use case area.
        In an \gls{ekg} context, especially at the higher levels of \gls{ekgmm} maturity,
        \myuline{all data is critical} since the criticality of data is always dependent on the context.
        For any given data point, there is a raison d'être in a given context.

    description={%
        an Internationalized Resource Identifier is defined similarly to a \glsxtrshort{uri},
        but the character set is extended to the Universal Coded Character Set.
        Therefore, it can contain any Latin and non-Latin characters except the reserved characters.
        Instead of extending the definition of \glsxtrshort{uri},
        the term IRI was introduced to allow for a clear distinction and avoid incompatibilities.
        IRIs are meant to replace URIs in identifying resources in situations where the Universal Coded Character Set
        is supported.
        By definition, every URI is an IRI.
        Furthermore, there is a defined surjective mapping of IRIs to URIs:
        Every IRI can be mapped to exactly one URI, but different IRIs might map to the same URI.
        Therefore, the conversion back from a URI to an IRI may not produce the original IRI.
        The IRI standard is a superset of the older \gls{uri} standard (IRI ⊃ URI).
        See also \gls{ekg:iri}.
